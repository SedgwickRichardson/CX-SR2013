<h2>Emissions  and fuel efficiency</h2>
<p> In 2013, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the Cathay  Pacific and Dragonair fleet remained steady at 15.5 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted  from fuel burn. This is an absolute emissions reduction from 2012 of 1.7%, or  0.27 million tCO<sub>2</sub>. A reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was also recorded in relation  to our capacity (grammes/ATK - available tonne kilometre) and traffic volume  carried (grammes/RTK - revenue tonne kilometre). This improvement in our fuel  efficiency is in line with our expectations as we continued to upgrade and  modernise our fleet while retiring less fuel-efficient aircraft. Since 1998,  our CO<sub>2</sub> efficiency in relation to ATK and RTK has improved by 12.2% and 19.3%  respectively.</p>

<p> Fuel efficiency achievements in 2013 included: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Fleet modernisation by taking  delivery of five Airbus A330-300s; nine Boeing 777-300ERs, and five Boeing  747-8Fs and retiring five Boeing 747-400 aircraft. </li>
  <li>Participated in the Asia and  Pacific Initiative to Reduce Emissions (ASPIRE) programme, operating four demonstration flights on 20 November 2013  from Hong Kong to Sydney, Melbourne, San Francisco and Anchorage respectively.  This also marked the first occasion when an airline operated four  near-simultaneous ASPIRE flights, including a cargo flight, a first of type flight  (the 747-8F) and the first to Anchorage.</li>
  <li>As part of the larger e-Enabled  aircraft programme, we installed the first electronic flight bag on a Boeing  777-300ER, paving the way for a paperless cockpit environment.</li>
  <li>Three of the five Boeing 747-8Fs  delivered are equipped with performance-improved GEnx-2B engines as part of the  aircrafts&rsquo; Performance Improvement Package. The upgraded engines will enhance  the aircraft&rsquo;s fuel efficiency by 1.8 percent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Biofuels</h2>
<p> Since the appointment of a dedicated Cathay  Pacific Biofuel Manager in 2011, we now have a robust sustainable aviation  fuels strategy in place and are progressing several projects.&nbsp; One of  these involves working with an international technology partner to undertake a  study on the feasibility of a Hong Kong based biojet fuel facility, producing  fuel made from commercial and household waste streams in the city.  This local supply chain could help reduce the  burden on landfill, and the use of this fuel would significantly reduce the net  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from our aircraft.  Outside  of Hong Kong, we continue to pursue opportunities that will lay the foundation  for a consistent, sustainable alternative biofuel source for the future.</p>
<h2> 38th ICAO  Assembly</h2>
<p> The International  Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly convened in Montreal,  Canada in October 2013, where representatives from 191 countries gathered to  discuss a range of issues pertinent to the global aviation industry, including  climate change.  The Assembly agreed to  proceed with the development of a global market-based measure (MBM) addressing  emissions from international aviation for the next Assembly to approve in 2016  and for implementation from 2020.  The  Assembly called upon Member States to engage in  constructive consultations when designing new and implementing existing MBMs  for international aviation. Cathay  Pacific&rsquo;s participation in the Aviation Global Deal and the IATA Climate Change  Task Force played a significant role in the process as it helped to gather  support between airlines and within IATA for the first comprehensive agreement  on climate change for any global sector. </p>
<h2> European Union Emissions Trading  Scheme</h2>
<p> Following the 38th ICAO Assembly, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/articles/news_2013101601_en.htm" target="_blank">European  Union (EU) announced its proposal</a> to amend the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)  so that aviation emissions would be covered for the  part of flights that takes place in European airspace. We  believe the proposal is not consistent with the resolution of the 38th  ICAO Assembly, where no prior consultation was conducted. The continual  amendments to the regulation also added to legislative uncertainty and posed an  additional layer of complexity for airlines striving to meet regulatory  requirements in all markets they operate in. Despite our opposition, we have  been making all the necessary preparations for full compliance with the EU ETS  regulation.</p>

<h2> Contribution to Climate  Change Science</h2>
<p> In 2013, one of our Airbus A330-300  aircraft was the first of its type to be equipped with <a href="http://www.iagos.org/" target="_blank">In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing  System (IAGOS)</a> scientific instruments following the certification of the system on  the Airbus A330. It has been deployed primarily on Australian and Middle East  routes from Hong Kong to complement other similarly equipped commercial  aircraft operating on other routes around the world. Data is transmitted from  the aircraft on a daily basis to the IAGOS central database for access by  science and policy users, including the provision of real time data for weather  prediction, air quality forecasting and climate models.  More information can be found on their  website at <a href="http://www.iagos.org" target="_blank">www.iagos.org</a>.</p>

<h2> FLY greener carbon offset</h2>
<p> Passengers continued to offset the emissions from their flights via <a href="http://www.cathaypacific.com/flygreener" target="_blank">FLYgreener</a>, Cathay Pacific&rsquo;s carbon offset programme. This amounted to 3,000 tCO<sub>2</sub> in 2013. Cathay Pacific and  Dragonair also offset the CO<sub>2</sub> impacts of staff travelling on  business, totaling 8,000 tCO<sub>2</sub> at an approximate cost of HK$. </p>
<p> The programme portfolio currently includes the  following renewable energy projects: </p>

<h2> Climate adaptation</h2>
<p> We began work on summarising international and local research on  climate change adaptation specific to the aviation industry. This work is  ongoing and we aim to share the results of this study with relevant departments  within the company in order to develop an implementation plan. In 2014, we plan  to trial the use of future scenario planning tools to assist more strategic  planning.</p>
<h2> Airport expansion</h2>
<p> As part of the Environment  Impact Assessment (EIA) for the plans to expand the Hong Kong International  Airport, the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) continued to carry out assessments  covering 12 environmental aspects.  Cathay  Pacific participated in numerous public and community engagement forums and an  exhibition organised by the AAHK to update and engage the public on the  progress of the EIA, which is expected to be completed in 2014. The EIA will be  subject to review by the Environmental Protection Department and the public to  ensure the requirements set out in the Study Brief have been met before an  application for an Environmental Permit can be submitted.</p>
<h2> Ground operations</h2>
<p> In 2013, the total electricity consumption at Cathay Pacific City  and Dragonair House was 33,677,483 kWH and 6,998,637 kWh respectively,  representing a decrease of 7% and 4.1%. The main savings were from chilled  water system optimisation and LED lighting replacements.</p>
<p> As part of the refurbishment and  revitalisation of our offices at Cathay City, a number of energy saving  features were adopted in the installation of lighting and window blinds. </p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.local.com/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/cathay_city_1.jpg" />
<p class="caption">The pioneer floor</p>
<p>At The Bridge, which was our newly refurbished lounge at the Hong Kong International Airport, heat recovery from a water-to-water heat pump was installed. The resultant energy saving will be report next year after the system has operated for a more extended period of time.</p>
<p>Our subsidiary businesses, including HAS, Vogue Laundry and Cathay Pacific Catering Services (CPCS), have been replacing existing equipment with newer, more efficient and lower emission models.</p>
<p>HAS, our ground handling company, completed the first term of their three-year Ground Support Equipment (GSE) Replacement Programme, replacing over 230 aged and less fuel efficient GSE and vehicles. The second term will commence in 2014.</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.local.com/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/cathay_city_2.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Electric tractor</p>
<p>At Vogue Laundry, a Euro V van was added to the fleet, with a further three Euro II trucks to be phased out in 2014. Vogue has also been reducing emissions through active carbon absorption in the dry cleaning machines and reducing consumption of perchloroethylene, a solvent consumed in the dry cleaning process. Consumption of this solvent was 7% less in 2013 compared to 2012.</p>
<p>CPCS installed cold room plastic curtains for outbound and trayset cold rooms, which reduced 27 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. They also installed nearly 450 LED light tubes, set the temperature at 1°C higher in some work areas, continued to use Towngas as boiler fuel. In the vehicle fleet, all pre-Euro type trucks have been replaced and the number of Euro V trucks was increased to 16 in 2013. </p>
