We envision a sustainable supply chain within the Cathay Pacific Group, and working with our suppliers is key to delivering products and services to our customers sustainably.</p>\r\nWe work with our suppliers on a supply chain sustainability compliance process as part of our risk management process. Many of our suppliers are companies who also report publicly on their sustainability performance and hold similar values towards corporate responsibility as ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn order to deliver products and services that are sustainably sourced, we need to work waith our suppliers. Developing a sustainable supply chain is a challenge due to the large amount of items we purchase, each with varying specifications. In some cases, we may not have leverage on all our suppliers and have limited influence on the sustainability attributes of these materials. Moreover, our specifications need to meet very strict safety standards, particularly if we are taking these items onboard. We are determined to find solutions to these challenges:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>We participate in best practice sharing sessions locally and internationally: Cathay Pacific chaired the Swire Sustainable Purchasing Working Group between 2007 and 2013, which looks at synergies within the Swire Group in embedding sustainable purchasing practices in the Swire Pacific companies. We were a founding member of the Hong Kong Green Purchasing Charter in 2008. In 2013, we were also one of the founding participants of the inaugural Sustainable Lifestyles Working Group launched by non-profit sustainability organisation BSR and sustainability communications firm Futerra.</li>\r\n	<li>We trial and use alternative materials and implement these across the Cathay Pacific Group: We often assess the performance of alternative materials. Once it passes the trial phase, we implement the material across the whole Group. For example, when we decided to switch all office paper to sustainably-sourced material, we assessed different options from recycled paper to paper made from FSC sources. Since our initial purchase of sustainable office paper in 2008, currently the majority of office paper, marketing paraphernalia in Hong Kong, training materials, inflight magazines and team newsletters have switched to FSC or recycled paper.</li>\r\n	<li>We are developing guidelines and sustainable specifications for a number of items: We developed a number of guidelines that list out the sustainable specifications we need to consider in our purchases. We now have guidelines for airport lounges, IT equipment, paper, plastic and printing. We aim to develop more guidelines to support decision-making with our purchasing team.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Sustainable Purchasing</h2>\r\nOur purchasing practices are set at the highest professional and ethical standards. Most of the purchasing requirements for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair are managed by the Airline Purchasing and Aircraft Trading Department. In addition to our anti-bribery expectations with all our staff, we require our purchasing staff to comply with our additional anti-bribery guidelines outlined in our Purchasing Ethics Policy.\r\n\r\nWe aim to encourage our suppliers to improve on their sustainability practices through capacity building and sharing knowledge on best practices as our approach to sustainable procurement. Our purchasing teams understand the need to consider sustainable purchasing and responsible supply chain practices in buying decisions. We require our suppliers to provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their progress in achieving our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct objectives.\r\n<h2>Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct</h2>\r\nSince the launch of our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct in 2007, suppliers to Cathay Pacific must provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their progress toward achieving our objectives contained in this Code. These include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Legal and regulatory compliance</li>\r\n	<li>Environmental management</li>\r\n	<li>No use of forced and child labour</li>\r\n	<li>Appropriate compensation and working hours</li>\r\n	<li>Health and safety in the workplace</li>\r\n	<li>No discrimination against employees</li>\r\n	<li>Upholding human rights in the workplace</li>\r\n	<li>Having high ethical standards</li>\r\n	<li>Extending social responsibility to their subcontractors and service providers</li>\r\n	<li>Maintaining documentation and permitting our inspection</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn developing and revising the Code, we took account of the International Labour Organization’s core conventions and other applicable and recognised labour standards, referred and benchmarked against the United Nations Global Compact.\r\n<div class="timeline-container clearfix">\r\n<h3>Timeline for Working with Our Supply Chain</h3>\r\n<div class="clearfix">2006Identified the need for a more coordinated approach to sustainability in our supply chain</div>\r\n<div class="clearfix">2007Developed and launched our Supplier Corporate, Social and Environmental Responsibility Code of ConductFirst questionnaires sent to Hong Kong-based suppliers\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="clearfix">2008Launched online tool for suppliers to complete questionnaire regarding their compliance with our Code.

A reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was also recorded in relation  to our capacity (grammes/ATK - available tonne kilometre) and traffic volume  carried (grammes/RTK - revenue tonne kilometre). This improvement in our fuel  efficiency is in line with our expectations as we continued to upgrade and  modernise our fleet while retiring less fuel-efficient aircraft.

Cathay  Pacific&rsquo;s participation in the Aviation Global Deal and the IATA Climate Change  Task Force played a significant role in the process as it helped to gather  support between airlines and within IATA for the first comprehensive agreement  on climate change for any global sector. </p>\r\n<h2> European Union Emissions Trading  Scheme</h2>\r\n<p> Following the 38th ICAO Assembly, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/articles/news_2013101601_en.htm" target="_blank">European  Union (EU) announced its proposal</a> to amend the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)  so that aviation emissions would be covered for the  part of flights that takes place in European airspace. We  believe the proposal is not consistent with the resolution of the 38th  ICAO Assembly, where no prior consultation was conducted. The continual  amendments to the regulation also added to legislative uncertainty and posed an  additional layer of complexity for airlines striving to meet regulatory  requirements in all markets they operate in. Despite our opposition, we have  been making all the necessary preparations for full compliance with the EU ETS  regulation.</p>\r\n<div class="timeline-container clearfix">\r\n  <h3>Global Efforts by the Aviation Industry in Reducing Emissions</h3>\r\n  <dl class="dl-horizontal">\r\n  	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2008</dt>\r\n    <dd>CX as a founding member of the Aviation Global Deal Group</dd>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2009</dt>\r\n    <dd>\r\n      <p>The aviation industry committed to new and ambitious targets for emissions reductions through IATA</p></dd>\r\n    </div>\r\n	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2010</dt>\r\n    <dd>Monitoring of CO<sub>2</sub> data began in compliance with the EU ETs</dd>\r\n    </div>\r\n	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2011</dt>\r\n    <dd>\r\n      <p>CX appointed to IATA Climate Change Task Force</p>\r\n    </dd>\r\n    </div>\r\n	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2012</dt>\r\n    <dd>\r\n      <p>CCTF completed extensive work around the implementation of CNG 2020</p>\r\n    </dd>\r\n    </div>\r\n	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2013</dt>\r\n    <dd>The agreed to proceed with the development of a global market-based measure for international aviation emission</dd>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </dl>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2> Contribution to Climate  Change Science</h2>\r\n<p> In 2013, one of our Airbus A330-300  aircraft was the first of its type to be equipped with <a href="http://www.iagos.org/" target="_blank">In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing  System (IAGOS)</a> scientific instruments following the certification of the system on  the Airbus A330.

This is an absolute emissions reduction from 2012 of 1.7%, or  0.27 million tCO<sub>2</sub>. A reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was also recorded in relation  to our capacity (grammes/ATK - available tonne kilometre) and traffic volume  carried (grammes/RTK - revenue tonne kilometre). This improvement in our fuel  efficiency is in line with our expectations as we continued to upgrade and  modernise our fleet while retiring less fuel-efficient aircraft. Since 1998,  our CO<sub>2</sub> efficiency in relation to ATK and RTK has improved by 12.2% and 19.3%  respectively.</p>\r\n<img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/ghg_emissions.jpg" />\r\n<p> Fuel efficiency achievements in 2013 included: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Fleet modernisation by taking  delivery of five Airbus A330-300s; nine Boeing 777-300ERs, and five Boeing  747-8Fs and retiring five Boeing 747-400 aircraft. </li>\r\n  <li>Participated in the Asia and  Pacific Initiative to Reduce Emissions (ASPIRE) programme, operating four demonstration flights on 20 November 2013  from Hong Kong to Sydney, Melbourne, San Francisco and Anchorage respectively.

Cathay  Pacific&rsquo;s participation in the Aviation Global Deal and the IATA Climate Change  Task Force played a significant role in the process as it helped to gather  support between airlines and within IATA for the first comprehensive agreement  on climate change for any global sector. </p>\r\n<h2> European Union Emissions Trading  Scheme</h2>\r\n<p> Following the 38th ICAO Assembly, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/articles/news_2013101601_en.htm" target="_blank">European  Union (EU) announced its proposal</a> to amend the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)  so that aviation emissions would be covered for the  part of flights that takes place in European airspace. We  believe the proposal is not consistent with the resolution of the 38th  ICAO Assembly, where no prior consultation was conducted. The continual  amendments to the regulation also added to legislative uncertainty and posed an  additional layer of complexity for airlines striving to meet regulatory  requirements in all markets they operate in. Despite our opposition, we have  been making all the necessary preparations for full compliance with the EU ETS  regulation.</p>\r\n<div class="timeline-container clearfix">\r\n  <h3>Global Efforts by the Aviation Industry in Reducing Emissions</h3>\r\n  <dl class="dl-horizontal">\r\n  	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2008</dt>\r\n    <dd>CX as a founding member of the Aviation Global Deal Group</dd>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2009</dt>\r\n    <dd>\r\n      <p>The aviation industry committed to new and ambitious targets for emissions reductions through IATA</p></dd>\r\n    </div>\r\n	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2010</dt>\r\n    <dd>Monitoring of CO<sub>2</sub> data began in compliance with the EU ETs</dd>\r\n    </div>\r\n	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2011</dt>\r\n    <dd>\r\n      <p>CX appointed to IATA Climate Change Task Force</p>\r\n    </dd>\r\n    </div>\r\n	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2012</dt>\r\n    <dd>\r\n      <p>CCTF completed extensive work around the implementation of CNG 2020</p>\r\n    </dd>\r\n    </div>\r\n	<div class="clearfix">\r\n    <dt>2013</dt>\r\n    <dd>The agreed to proceed with the development of a global market-based measure for international aviation emission</dd>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </dl>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2> Contribution to Climate  Change Science</h2>\r\n<p> In 2013, one of our Airbus A330-300  aircraft was the first of its type to be equipped with <a href="http://www.iagos.org/" target="_blank">In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing  System (IAGOS)</a> scientific instruments following the certification of the system on  the Airbus A330.

Since 2010, we have been developing our Sustainable Development Strategy to bring about positive change and minimise the impact of our operations on the environment. Only then can our business operate far into the future. This is a significant challenge, but it is also an opportunity for progress.\r\n\r\nThe involvement of our stakeholders is an indispensible part of this business vision. We have been listening to our diverse stakeholders’ needs and concerns, and we are responding by engaging and working with them to find solutions to reduce our impacts and reach our targets.\r\n\r\nI am proud of our staff team who are passionate about influencing positive sustainability behaviour, and challenging stakeholders to think out of the box about the way things are done, be it with their colleagues or our suppliers. They work collaboratively across functions to identify issues, best practices and improvements, to ensure that sustainability are considered when making operational decisions. We will continue to encourage these practices so more of our staff understand sustainability is a key part of our airline’s business vision. I invite you to view the <a href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/resources/video-gallery/">video stories</a> featured in this year’s report for a glimpse of what some of them have made possible.\r\n\r\nAt the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Annual General Meeting in June 2013, Cathay Pacific, together with other members, endorsed the resolution for the industry to implement carbon neutral growth from 2020, also known as “CNG2020”, by means of a single market-based measure (MBM). For a number of years, Cathay Pacific has been closely involved in discussions on international aviation CO<sub>2</sub> emissions regulation, most notably as part of IATA’s Climate Change Task Force. It was therefore very welcome news in October when the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly, comprising 191 states, agreed to proceed with the development of a global mechanism to tackle international aviation emissions.\r\n\r\nAs the first comprehensive agreement on climate change for any global industrial sector, the period between now and the next ICAO Assembly in 2016 will be critical in the formation of the “building blocks” of this scheme. We also acknowledge the positive move made by the European Union (EU) in November to ‘stop the clock’ on extending the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to international aviation to provide space for ICAO to reach such an agreement.\r\n\r\nAt Cathay Pacific, we have been clear about our own environmental commitments so we are naturally supportive of the ICAO agreement. With the industry commitment to CNG2020 and our own CO<sub>2</sub> reduction target firmly in place, we are moving in the right direction towards a more sustainable future for aviation.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, our industry continues to face a highly volatile operating environment. We have to be flexible in dealing with “new norms” and be adaptive to the demands of a rapidly changing operating environment. In 2013, whilst our passenger business was generally robust, fuel prices remained on a high plateau and the cargo market continued to be weak. In addition to responding to these short to medium term difficulties, we are also future-proofing our business by continuously strengthening ourselves in different ways — with our fleet, the network, flight frequencies, our products and services, the loyalty and Frequent Flyer programmes, and importantly, our team of people. Specifically, Cathay Pacific continued to invest in modernising our aircrafts, which will enable us to reduce fuel usage, carbon emissions, and noise pollution to the local community, and hence creating value for our stakeholders.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that our investments are going to pay dividends in the long run, and together with our outstanding team which is the best in the business, our best days lie ahead.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/ceo-signature.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\n<strong>Ivan Chu</strong>\r\nChief Executive', 'Message from the Chief Executive', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'message-from-the-chief-executive', '', '', '2014-07-21 04:55:07', '2014-07-21 04:55:07', '', 2, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/?page_id=26', 1, 'page', '', 0),

We then implemented these on our long-haul flights beginning with our nonstop flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver in 1982, and applied this approach throughout our fleet and worldwide routes.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Swire Group, a statement in 1989 by our honorary life president and former Chairman, Sir Adrian Swire, continues to inspire the company’s direction:\r\n<blockquote>“As a Group we should always seek to be ahead of legislation rather than reacting to it: that even if the environmentally “clean” way of doing something is more expensive and therefore on the face of it uneconomic, we should always, regardless of mandatory legislation, have a close look at the overall feasibility of adopting such a practice, both from the point of view of general public good and enlightened self-interest.”</blockquote>\r\nThis approach defines what sustainable development means to us – it is about applying long term thinking in the business, doing the right thing by the environment and our stakeholders, which results in long term success and a sustained existence.\r\n\r\nCathay Pacific’s current programme of CSR activities began back in 1991 with the launch of Change for Good, although we already had community activities since the 1970’s, with the purpose of giving back to Hong Kong and to the communities in which we operate in.\r\n\r\nOn employee remuneration, we became one of the first companies in Hong Kong to provide flexible benefit schemes to our employees and formal management training programmes for pilots, engineers and general managers.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, we became one of the first Hong Kong companies to publish a voluntary publicly available Environmental Report for our stakeholders, which eventually evolved into our first Sustainable Development Report in 2009.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, with the support of various departments, we launched our Sustainable Development Strategy 20/20 commitments.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, thanks to the concerted effort of our colleagues, we were one of the few airlines and Hong Kong companies to be listed simultaneously in the FTSE4Good, Dow Jones Sustainability Index Asia-Pacific, and the Hang Seng Sustainability Index. We were also listed as a constituent of the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index Asia ex-Japan category under the Carbon Disclosure Project.\r\n\r\nOur journey has not been easy, but it has been rewarding –since 1980, we have experienced our record-breaking profit years and our first profit loss; we have gone through Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS); a number of economic downturns; to record highs in Hong Kong’s economy. Throughout this time, we have seen our sustainability commitments mature – starting from looking purely at environmental issues; to include social issues, and now beginning to integrate environmental, social and economic issues – the basic components of “sustainability”.\r\n\r\nThis year’s report highlights how far we have come, but also illustrates how much work still needs to be done. There is still some way to go before reaching our goal of fully embedding the value and practice of sustainability into how we conduct day-to-day business. In the 1980s, sustainability issues were not yet considered a priority for the world at large. Sustainability issues have become far more complex, the solutions need to be more innovative, and the actions need to be taken more urgently. While we have made significant progress, we need to work faster.\r\n\r\nThe aviation industry faces many challenges: rising fuel costs, access to diminishing natural resources, limited talent pool, increasing and uncertain regulations, and a fragile economic recovery. We continue to take sustainability seriously and place it high on our agenda as our success as a company depends on the success of society – we need thriving economies, sufficient sustainable natural resources and the right people to drive our future growth. We know this is not something we can achieve by ourselves. For the past few years we have been working with our partners – our stakeholders – employees, regulators, government, customers, suppliers, communities, non-governmental organisations, and other specialists – to make not only our vision possible, but to make our collective goal of connectivity sustainable for the long term.\r\n\r\nWe invite you, our stakeholders, and our readers to join us in making these sustainable connections possible.', 'Approach to Sustainable Development', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'approach-to-sustainable-development', '', '', '2014-07-18 10:41:51', '2014-07-18 10:41:51', '', 2, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/?page_id=28', 3, 'page', '', 0),

These five priority areas enable us to set specific targets and move purposefully toward our goal. They also encompass the key components of who we are and how we work. In 2012, we launched our 20/20 SD commitments, and each commitment is highlighted under each of the five priority areas.\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-sm-8"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/approach-to-sustainable-development.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>Our Sustainable Development Targets</h2>\r\nAlthough the 20 commitments are being implemented by different business functions, and, in turn, address different stakeholder priorities, they all promote Cathay Pacific’s sustainable development targets which cut across the group’s activities and aim to:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Reduce our overall emissions;</li>\r\n	<li>Offer sustainably sourced products and services to our customers; and</li>\r\n	<li>Ensure our community programmes are relevant and effective to the beneficiaries.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis is what the above three targets mean to us:\r\n<ol class="list-with-h3-heading">\r\n	<li>\r\n<h3>Reducing Emissions</h3>\r\nAccording to the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/aviation/index.php?idp=68" target="_blank">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) and the <a href="http://www.iea.org/co2highlights/co2highlights.pdf" target="_blank">International Energy Agency</a> (IEA), aviation currently accounts for 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. As aviation grows to meet increasing demand, the IPCC has forecasted that, by 2050, the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions could rise to 3%. While forecasts for 2050 can vary significantly, they highlight a challenge that the aviation industry will face over the next 40 years.\r\n\r\nProjected increases in our emissions cannot be left unchecked, and that is why we are firmly committed to reducing our impacts. The industry has directed significant investment towards addressing the challenge, introducing new technology, better operating procedures and sustainable biofuels.\r\n\r\nWithin Cathay Pacific, aircraft emissions constitute 99% of our overall CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Therefore we have committed to manage our carbon emissions and contribute to global efforts to reduce aviation’s impact on the environment and climate change. In fact, we commit to improving our fuel efficiency by 2% year on year to 2020, which is in line with ICAO’s target for the industry. At the same time, we are actively managing the energy and water impacts of our facilities, vehicle fleet and the equipment we use across our subsidiaries.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about our performance on this target, go to our <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_D1_Climate_Change_Factsheet.pdf">Climate Change factsheet</a> .</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<h3>Offering Sustainably Sourced Products and Minimising Resource Use</h3>\r\nWe continually examine options to reduce resource use throughout our supply chain and to use materials from sustainable sources (such as Forestry Stewardship Council and Marine Stewardship Council-certified products, or recycled materials). We ensure our procurement team understand the requirements of our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct, so they can, in turn, ensure our suppliers comply with our standards. We also look for opportunities to improve recycling and waste management across all facets of our operations.

English On Air provides English-speaking opportunities for young Hong Kong residents. The LBG methodology involves assessing how our goals align with beneficiaries’ needs and expectations. We aim to ensure that our community programmes truly respond to their needs and play to our strengths.\r\nOur global community investment strategy is to leverage the resources of our company and to motivate our staff and passengers to address the needs of the communities we serve, focusing mainly on three areas: youth and education, medical care and environmental conservation.\r\n\r\nApart from our work in Hong Kong, we strongly encourage our outport staff to get involved in their local communities and to proactively identify appropriate NGO partners with a view to exploring cooperation opportunities that will benefit the local community.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nTo learn more about our performance on this target, go to our <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_A3_Community_Investment_Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">Community Investment factsheet</a> and <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_H1_Our_People_Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">Our People factsheet</a>.', 'Sustainable Development Strategy', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'sustainable-development-strategy', '', '', '2014-07-18 04:21:25', '2014-07-18 04:21:25', '', 28, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/?page_id=30', 1, 'page', '', 0),

This aligns directly with our need to communicate those issues that impact and/or are highly relevant to our company.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, with the launch of our 20 strategic commitments last year, we would like to report on how we are performing; as well as invite our stakeholders to join us in meeting not only our goal to embed sustainability into our business, but to ensure that our common goal of connectivity and sustainable travel can be achieved.\r\n\r\nTo confirm stakeholder priorities, a detailed assessment was conducted on the findings of past years’ engagement exercises. Although the importance of certain issues, such as waste management, sustainable sourcing and biodiversity, has increased over the years, some of the topics such as climate change have remained high as stakeholders’ priorities over the years.

This year’s theme for our Sustainable Development Report, Making the Connection, is particularly relevant.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 alone, over 29 million people travelled with Cathay Pacific and Dragonair between the 140 destinations offered by our global network.\r\nAcross the whole industry, over 3 billion passengers travelled by air in 2013. Once considered a luxury, flying has become more accessible, with nearly 50,000 routes served in total globally.\r\n\r\nAviation not only provides jobs, trade links, connectivity and tourism. It also provides support for sustainable development through air travel, whether by supporting the transportation of sustainable agricultural products, connecting the global supply chains, providing vital lifelines to many remote communities including small island states and offering rapid disaster response. In essence, aviation is the real “world wide web”<a class="note-link" href="#note1">1</a>.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making physical connections, this year’s theme reflects our desire for deeper engagement with our stakeholders. Since our first Environmental Report in 1996, we have been bringing our stakeholders on board this journey by progressively reporting on our environmental performance more transparently and comprehensively. In doing so, we wanted stakeholders to know where we stand on the issues that are of concern to them, our plans for addressing the impacts of our operations, how we are progressing, and how they can help us improve our performance. It is about connecting our stakeholders and our sustainability issues closer together.\r\n\r\nThe industry continues to balance the dual challenges of sustained high price of jet fuel and weak air cargo demand with the need to remain profitable against the backdrop of extremely thin margins.

This year’s theme for our Sustainable Development Report, Making the Connection, is particularly relevant.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 alone, over 29 million people travelled with Cathay Pacific and Dragonair between the 140 destinations offered by our global network.\r\nAcross the whole industry, over 3 billion passengers travelled by air in 2013. Once considered a luxury, flying has become more accessible, with nearly 50,000 routes served in total globally.\r\n\r\nAviation not only provides jobs, trade links, connectivity and tourism. It also provides support for sustainable development through air travel, whether by supporting the transportation of sustainable agricultural products, connecting the global supply chains, providing vital lifelines to many remote communities including small island states and offering rapid disaster response. In essence, aviation is the real “world wide web”<a class="note-link" href="#note1">1</a>.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making physical connections, this year’s theme reflects our desire for deeper engagement with our stakeholders. Since our first Environmental Report in 1996, we have been bringing our stakeholders on board this journey by progressively reporting on our environmental performance more transparently and comprehensively. In doing so, we wanted stakeholders to know where we stand on the issues that are of concern to them, our plans for addressing the impacts of our operations, how we are progressing, and how they can help us improve our performance. It is about connecting our stakeholders and our sustainability issues closer together.\r\n\r\nThe industry continues to balance the dual challenges of sustained high price of jet fuel and weak air cargo demand with the need to remain profitable against the backdrop of extremely thin margins.  We believe that tackling these challenges successfully and effectively would put us on the trajectory to creating value for our stakeholders. It is about connecting our operational impacts to value creation.\r\n<blockquote>“Building an economically efficient and sustainable platform is now the order of the day, and this of course involves a large number of stakeholders and is indeed a huge challenge. But what is progress if not the overcoming of challenges?”</blockquote>\r\n<p class="quote-source">Chairman, John Slosar</p>\r\nInnovation is the core ingredient that will help us make the step changes in the approach to our everyday actions and technological advancement. We want to collaborate with our stakeholders, both internal and external, to help us perform better and meet our sustainability commitments. We need to draw on the diverse resources and expertise within our business, the industry and our wider stakeholders. Together we work better, and our stakeholders are the ones that hold the key to innovation. It is about connecting our commitments to innovation.\r\n<blockquote>“I am very proud of the work done by my team at Cathay Pacific – and that team includes innovators from purchasing to product to IT to flight operations.”</blockquote>\r\n<p class="quote-source">Chief Executive, Ivan Chu</p>\r\nWe look forward to creating more opportunities for us to excel at what we do, and thus moving us closer to our vision: to be the worlds’ best airline. It is about connecting our Sustainable Development Strategy to our business vision.\r\n\r\nIn this report, we begin to monitor the progress we have made during the year on the commitments launched in the last report. As we move forward towards 2020, we aim to achieve even more. As our stakeholders, we want to invite you to help us make these connections work.\r\n\r\n<img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/4-connections.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<div class="note-container">\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong>\r\n<p class="note"><a name="note1"></a>Oxford Economics, Aviation: The Real World Wide Web, Onward Publishing</p>\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Making the Connection', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '66-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-16 15:25:42', '2014-07-16 15:25:42', '', 66, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/66-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We then implemented these on our long-haul flights beginning with our nonstop flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver in 1982, and applied this approach throughout our fleet and worldwide routes.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Swire Group, a statement in 1989 by our honorary life president and former Chairman, Sir Adrian Swire, continues to inspire the company’s direction:\r\n<blockquote>“As a Group we should always seek to be ahead of legislation rather than reacting to it: that even if the environmentally “clean” way of doing something is more expensive and therefore on the face of it uneconomic, we should always, regardless of mandatory legislation, have a close look at the overall feasibility of adopting such a practice, both from the point of view of general public good and enlightened self-interest.”</blockquote>\r\nThis approach defines what sustainable development means to us – it is about applying long term thinking in the business, doing the right thing by the environment and our stakeholders, which results in long term success and a sustained existence.\r\n\r\nCathay Pacific’s current programme of CSR activities began back in 1991 with the launch of Change for Good, although we already had community activities since the 1970’s, with the purpose of giving back to Hong Kong and to the communities in which we operate in.\r\n\r\nOn employee remuneration, we became one of the first companies in Hong Kong to provide flexible benefit schemes to our employees and formal management training programmes for pilots, engineers and general managers.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, we became one of the first Hong Kong companies to publish a voluntary publicly available Environmental Report for our stakeholders, which eventually evolved into our first Sustainable Development Report in 2009.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, with the support of various departments, we launched our Sustainable Development Strategy 20/20 commitments.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, thanks to the concerted effort of our colleagues, we were one of the few airlines and Hong Kong companies to be listed simultaneously in the FTSE4Good, Dow Jones Sustainability Index Asia-Pacific, and the Hang Seng Sustainability Index. We were also listed as a constituent of the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index Asia ex-Japan category under the Carbon Disclosure Project.\r\n\r\nOur journey has not been easy, but it has been rewarding –since 1980, we have experienced our record-breaking profit years and our first profit loss; we have gone through Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS); a number of economic downturns; to record highs in Hong Kong’s economy. Throughout this time, we have seen our sustainability commitments mature – starting from looking purely at environmental issues; to include social issues, and now beginning to integrate environmental, social and economic issues – the basic components of “sustainability”.\r\n\r\nThis year’s report highlights how far we have come, but also illustrates how much work still needs to be done. There is still some way to go before reaching our goal of fully embedding the value and practice of sustainability into how we conduct day-to-day business. In the 1980s, sustainability issues were not yet considered a priority for the world at large.

We are in it for the long term in order for our business to be successful and sustainable.”</blockquote>\r\nCathay Pacific has an unwavering commitment to sustainability. Since 2010, we have been developing our Sustainable Development Strategy to bring about positive change and minimise the impact of our operations on the environment. Only then can our business operate far into the future. This is a significant challenge, but it is also an opportunity for progress.\r\n\r\nThe involvement of our stakeholders is an indispensible part of this business vision.  We have been listening to our diverse stakeholders’ needs and concerns, and we are responding by engaging and working with them to find solutions to reduce our impacts and reach our targets.\r\n\r\nI am proud of our staff team who are passionate about influencing positive sustainability behaviour, and challenging stakeholders to think out of the box about the way things are done, be it with their colleagues or our suppliers. They work collaboratively across functions to identify issues, best practices and improvements, to ensure that sustainability are considered when making operational decisions. We will continue to encourage these practices so more of our staff understand sustainability is a key part of our airline’s business vision. I invite you to view the <a href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/resources/video-gallery/">video stories</a> featured in this year’s report for a glimpse of what some of them have made possible.\r\n\r\nAt the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Annual General Meeting in June 2013, Cathay Pacific, together with other members, endorsed the resolution for the industry to implement carbon neutral growth from 2020, also known as “CNG2020”, by means of a single market-based measure (MBM). For a number of years, Cathay Pacific has been closely involved in discussions on international aviation CO<sub>2</sub> emissions regulation, most notably as part of IATA’s Climate Change Task Force.  It was therefore very welcome news in October when the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly, comprising  191 states, agreed to proceed with the development of a global mechanism to tackle international aviation emissions.\r\n\r\nAs the first comprehensive agreement on climate change for any global industrial sector, the period between now and the next ICAO Assembly in 2016 will be critical in the formation of the “building blocks” of this scheme. We also acknowledge the positive move made by the European Union (EU) in November to ‘stop the clock’ on extending the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to international aviation to provide space for ICAO to reach such an agreement.\r\nAt Cathay Pacific, we have been clear about our own environmental commitments so we are naturally supportive of the ICAO agreement. With the industry commitment to CNG2020 and our own CO<sub>2</sub> reduction target firmly in place, we are moving in the right direction towards a more sustainable future for aviation.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, our industry continues to face a highly volatile operating environment.  We have to be flexible in dealing with “new norms” and be adaptive to the demands of a rapidly changing operating environment. In 2013, whilst our passenger business was generally robust, fuel prices remained on a high plateau and the cargo market continued to be weak. In addition to responding to these short to medium term difficulties, we are also future-proofing our business by continuously strengthening ourselves in different ways — with our fleet, the network, flight frequencies, our products and services, the loyalty and Frequent Flyer programmes, and importantly, our team of people.  Specifically, Cathay Pacific continued to invest in modernising our aircrafts, which will enable us to reduce fuel usage, carbon emissions, and noise pollution to the local community, and hence creating value for our stakeholders.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that our investments are going to pay dividends in the long run, and together with our outstanding team which is the best in the business, our best days lie ahead.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/ceo-signature.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\n<strong>Ivan Chu</strong>\r\nChief Executive', 'Message from the Chief Executive', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '26-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-16 15:34:19', '2014-07-16 15:34:19', '', 26, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/26-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This year’s theme for our Sustainable Development Report, Making the Connection, is particularly relevant.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 alone, over 29 million people travelled with Cathay Pacific and Dragonair between the 140 destinations offered by our global network.\r\nAcross the whole industry, over 3 billion passengers travelled by air in 2013. Once considered a luxury, flying has become more accessible, with nearly 50,000 routes served in total globally.\r\n\r\nAviation not only provides jobs, trade links, connectivity and tourism. It also provides support for sustainable development through air travel, whether by supporting the transportation of sustainable agricultural products, connecting the global supply chains, providing vital lifelines to many remote communities including small island states and offering rapid disaster response. In essence, aviation is the real “world wide web”<a class="note-link" href="#note1">1</a>.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making physical connections, this year’s theme reflects our desire for deeper engagement with our stakeholders.

These five priority areas enable us to set specific targets and move purposefully toward our goal. They also encompass the key components of who we are and how we work.  In 2012, we launched our 20/20 SD commitments, and each commitment is highlighted under each of the five priority areas.\r\n\r\n<img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/approach-to-sustainable-development.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h2>Our Sustainable Development Targets</h2>\r\nAlthough the 20 commitments are being implemented by different business functions, and, in turn, address different stakeholder priorities, they all promote Cathay Pacific’s sustainable development targets which cut across the group’s activities and aim to:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Reduce our overall emissions;</li>\r\n	<li>Offer sustainably sourced products and services to our customers; and</li>\r\n	<li>Ensure our community programmes are relevant and effective to the beneficiaries.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis is what the above three targets mean to us:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n<h3>Reducing Emissions</h3>\r\nAccording to the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/aviation/index.php?idp=68" target="_blank">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) and the <a href="http://www.iea.org/co2highlights/co2highlights.pdf" target="_blank">International Energy Agency</a> (IEA), aviation currently accounts for 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. As aviation grows to meet increasing demand, the IPCC has forecasted that, by 2050, the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions could rise to 3%. While forecasts for 2050 can vary significantly, they highlight a challenge that the aviation industry will face over the next 40 years.\r\n\r\nProjected increases in our emissions cannot be left unchecked, and that is why we are firmly committed to reducing our impacts. The industry has directed significant investment towards addressing the challenge, introducing new technology, better operating procedures and sustainable biofuels.\r\n\r\nWithin Cathay Pacific, aircraft emissions constitute 99% of our overall CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Therefore we have committed to manage our carbon emissions and contribute to global efforts to reduce aviation’s impact on the environment and climate change. In fact, we commit to improving our fuel efficiency by 2% year on year to 2020, which is in line with ICAO’s target for the industry. At the same time, we are actively managing the energy and water impacts of our facilities, vehicle fleet and the equipment we use across our subsidiaries.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about our performance on this target, go to our <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_D1_Climate_Change_Factsheet.pdf">Climate Change factsheet</a> .</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<h3>Offering Sustainably Sourced Products and Minimising Resource Use</h3>\r\nWe continually examine options to reduce resource use throughout our supply chain and to use materials from sustainable sources (such as Forestry Stewardship Council and Marine Stewardship Council-certified products, or recycled materials). We ensure our procurement team understand the requirements of our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct, so they can, in turn, ensure our suppliers comply with our standards. We also look for opportunities to improve recycling and waste management across all facets of our operations.  These include products and services provided inflight and at airport lounges, back office operations and the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) process of our aircraft.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about our performance on this target, go to our <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_E1_Waste_Management_Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">Waste Management factsheet</a>, <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_F1_Sustainable_Sourcing_Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">Sustainable Sourcing factsheet</a> and <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_G1_Biodiversity_Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">Biodiversity factsheet</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<h3>Ensuring the Effectiveness of Community Programmes</h3>\r\nWe support and invest in the Hong Kong community, of which we have been a part for more than six decades. Local staff members are also active in community initiatives in the outport countries where we have a presence.\r\n\r\nSince 2011, we began making reference to the internationally-recognised London Benchmarking Group (LBG) methodology in evaluating one of our flagship projects, English On Air. English On Air provides English-speaking opportunities for young Hong Kong residents. The LBG methodology involves assessing how our goals align with beneficiaries’ needs and expectations. We aim to ensure that our community programmes truly respond to their needs and play to our strengths.\r\nOur global community investment strategy is to leverage the resources of our company and to motivate our staff and passengers to address the needs of the communities we serve, focusing mainly on three areas: youth and education, medical care and environmental conservation.\r\n\r\nApart from our work in Hong Kong, we strongly encourage our outport staff to get involved in their local communities and to proactively identify appropriate NGO partners with a view to exploring cooperation opportunities that will benefit the local community.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nTo learn more about our performance on this target, go to our <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_A3_Community_Investment_Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">Community Investment factsheet</a> and <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_H1_Our_People_Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">Our People factsheet</a>.', 'Sustainable Development Strategy', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '30-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-17 08:22:55', '2014-07-17 08:22:55', '', 30, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/30-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

However, overall we are still facing the pressure from this sustained high price, which remained the Group’s most significant cost.  The cargo business also continued to be affected by strong competition and weak demand.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenging operating environment, we are committed to further developing Hong Kong as a world leading aviation hub. This is reflected in our investment in network development, fleet upgrades, providing superior service and quality products.  As at 31st December 2013, we have another 93 new aircraft due for delivery up to 2024.\r\n\r\nWe took measures to improve our efficiency, by reducing long-haul frequencies and accelerating the retirement of the less fuel efficient Boeing 747-400 aircraft. On the cargo side, we adjusted capacity in line with demand throughout the year, reducing the size of our freighter fleet and at the same time increased its efficiency.\r\n\r\nOur strategy is to continue to focus on ensuring that our service proposition to the customer remains strong; improving productivity; developing the strategic relationship with Air China; and maintaining a prudent approach to financial risk management.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to invest to make our business stronger while keeping our financial position strong.', 'Overview of 2013', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'overview-2013', '', '', '2014-07-17 15:02:50', '2014-07-17 15:02:50', '', 9, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/?page_id=88', 1, 'page', '', 0),

However, overall we are still facing the pressure from this sustained high price, which remained the Group’s most significant cost.  The cargo business also continued to be affected by strong competition and weak demand.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenging operating environment, we are committed to further developing Hong Kong as a world leading aviation hub. This is reflected in our investment in network development, fleet upgrades, providing superior service and quality products.  As at 31st December 2013, we have another 93 new aircraft due for delivery up to 2024.\r\n\r\nWe took measures to improve our efficiency, by reducing long-haul frequencies and accelerating the retirement of the less fuel efficient Boeing 747-400 aircraft. On the cargo side, we adjusted capacity in line with demand throughout the year, reducing the size of our freighter fleet and at the same time increased its efficiency.\r\n\r\nOur strategy is to continue to focus on ensuring that our service proposition to the customer remains strong; improving productivity; developing the strategic relationship with Air China; and maintaining a prudent approach to financial risk management.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to invest to make our business stronger while keeping our financial position strong.', 'Overview of 2013', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '88-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-17 08:57:19', '2014-07-17 08:57:19', '', 88, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/88-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

However, overall we are still facing the pressure from this sustained high price, which remained the Group’s most significant cost.  The cargo business also continued to be affected by strong competition and weak demand.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenging operating environment, we are committed to further developing Hong Kong as a world leading aviation hub. This is reflected in our investment in network development, fleet upgrades, providing superior service and quality products.  As at 31st December 2013, we have another 93 new aircraft due for delivery up to 2024.\r\n\r\nWe took measures to improve our efficiency, by reducing long-haul frequencies and accelerating the retirement of the less fuel efficient Boeing 747-400 aircraft. On the cargo side, we adjusted capacity in line with demand throughout the year, reducing the size of our freighter fleet and at the same time increased its efficiency.\r\n\r\nOur strategy is to continue to focus on ensuring that our service proposition to the customer remains strong; improving productivity; developing the strategic relationship with Air China; and maintaining a prudent approach to financial risk management.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to invest to make our business stronger while keeping our financial position strong.', 'Overview of 2013', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '88-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-17 15:02:50', '2014-07-17 15:02:50', '', 88, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/88-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Since 2010, we have been developing our Sustainable Development Strategy to bring about positive change and minimise the impact of our operations on the environment. Only then can our business operate far into the future. This is a significant challenge, but it is also an opportunity for progress.\r\n\r\nThe involvement of our stakeholders is an indispensible part of this business vision. We have been listening to our diverse stakeholders’ needs and concerns, and we are responding by engaging and working with them to find solutions to reduce our impacts and reach our targets.\r\n\r\nI am proud of our staff team who are passionate about influencing positive sustainability behaviour, and challenging stakeholders to think out of the box about the way things are done, be it with their colleagues or our suppliers. They work collaboratively across functions to identify issues, best practices and improvements, to ensure that sustainability are considered when making operational decisions. We will continue to encourage these practices so more of our staff understand sustainability is a key part of our airline’s business vision. I invite you to view the <a href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/resources/video-gallery/">video stories</a> featured in this year’s report for a glimpse of what some of them have made possible.\r\n\r\nAt the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Annual General Meeting in June 2013, Cathay Pacific, together with other members, endorsed the resolution for the industry to implement carbon neutral growth from 2020, also known as “CNG2020”, by means of a single market-based measure (MBM). For a number of years, Cathay Pacific has been closely involved in discussions on international aviation CO<sub>2</sub> emissions regulation, most notably as part of IATA’s Climate Change Task Force. It was therefore very welcome news in October when the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly, comprising 191 states, agreed to proceed with the development of a global mechanism to tackle international aviation emissions.\r\n\r\nAs the first comprehensive agreement on climate change for any global industrial sector, the period between now and the next ICAO Assembly in 2016 will be critical in the formation of the “building blocks” of this scheme. We also acknowledge the positive move made by the European Union (EU) in November to ‘stop the clock’ on extending the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to international aviation to provide space for ICAO to reach such an agreement.\r\nAt Cathay Pacific, we have been clear about our own environmental commitments so we are naturally supportive of the ICAO agreement. With the industry commitment to CNG2020 and our own CO<sub>2</sub> reduction target firmly in place, we are moving in the right direction towards a more sustainable future for aviation.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, our industry continues to face a highly volatile operating environment. We have to be flexible in dealing with “new norms” and be adaptive to the demands of a rapidly changing operating environment. In 2013, whilst our passenger business was generally robust, fuel prices remained on a high plateau and the cargo market continued to be weak. In addition to responding to these short to medium term difficulties, we are also future-proofing our business by continuously strengthening ourselves in different ways — with our fleet, the network, flight frequencies, our products and services, the loyalty and Frequent Flyer programmes, and importantly, our team of people. Specifically, Cathay Pacific continued to invest in modernising our aircrafts, which will enable us to reduce fuel usage, carbon emissions, and noise pollution to the local community, and hence creating value for our stakeholders.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that our investments are going to pay dividends in the long run, and together with our outstanding team which is the best in the business, our best days lie ahead.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/ceo-signature.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\n<strong>Ivan Chu</strong>\r\nChief Executive', 'Message from the Chief Executive', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '26-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-18 02:22:32', '2014-07-18 02:22:32', '', 26, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/26-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In 2013, there were no events classified as accidents, which was the same as in 2012. There were eight ''high risk'' safety incidents in 2013, compared to one in 2012. Five of these were related to loading or load integrity on the freighter fleet. Another one was the collapse of an airport passenger bridge at the Hong Kong International Airport.

These are shown in the <a href="#">Safety Key Performance Indicators (KPI) table</a>. Where possible these safety metrics are benchmarked against other airlines, industry performance and best practices.\r\n\r\nCathay Pacific has a very complex passenger and freighter network with pilots based all over the world living in vastly different time zones. This has created a very challenging task in pilot rostering and fatigue management. Consequently, managing pilot fatigue risk is an important component of Cathay Pacific''s SMS. Therefore, during 2013, we continued to develop and mature the Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) that was established in 2011.

Reporting of fatigue increased slightly throughout 2013 and changes were made to rostering to address issues identified via fatigue reporting. Regular issues of the ‘FRMS Newsletter to Pilots’ kept flight crew informed on the KA FRMS. KA will commence roster analysis using the FAST fatigue software in 2014.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the work to improve Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and reduce crew and staff injury, the overall Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) has stabilised following a slight reduction. In 2013, we conducted a safety campaign called “Think Safe”, which is our injury preventive initiative for cabin crew handling passenger’s baggage. Our cabin crew are not encouraged to handle passenger’s baggage for OHS reasons. However, should they be required to assist passengers with special needs (such as passengers who are frail or infirm, the elderly, minors travelling alone and passengers travelling with infants or small children), they should always assess the weight of the baggage by conducting a “lift check” before any manual handling. If the weight of the baggage is beyond their capacity, they should always seek assistance from a fellow cabin crew or try an alternative such as breaking the load, or having the baggage offloaded to the cargo hold. It is important that our cabin crew look after themselves whilst providing excellent service.

This is a significant challenge, but it is also an opportunity for progress.\r\n\r\nThe involvement of our stakeholders is an indispensible part of this business vision.

They work collaboratively across functions to identify issues, best practices and improvements, to ensure that sustainability are considered when making operational decisions. We will continue to encourage these practices so more of our staff understand sustainability is a key part of our airline’s business vision. I invite you to view the <a href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/resources/video-gallery/">video stories</a> featured in this year’s report for a glimpse of what some of them have made possible.\r\n\r\nAt the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Annual General Meeting in June 2013, Cathay Pacific, together with other members, endorsed the resolution for the industry to implement carbon neutral growth from 2020, also known as “CNG2020”, by means of a single market-based measure (MBM). For a number of years, Cathay Pacific has been closely involved in discussions on international aviation CO<sub>2</sub> emissions regulation, most notably as part of IATA’s Climate Change Task Force. It was therefore very welcome news in October when the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly, comprising 191 states, agreed to proceed with the development of a global mechanism to tackle international aviation emissions.\r\n\r\nAs the first comprehensive agreement on climate change for any global industrial sector, the period between now and the next ICAO Assembly in 2016 will be critical in the formation of the “building blocks” of this scheme. We also acknowledge the positive move made by the European Union (EU) in November to ‘stop the clock’ on extending the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to international aviation to provide space for ICAO to reach such an agreement.\r\nAt Cathay Pacific, we have been clear about our own environmental commitments so we are naturally supportive of the ICAO agreement. With the industry commitment to CNG2020 and our own CO<sub>2</sub> reduction target firmly in place, we are moving in the right direction towards a more sustainable future for aviation.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, our industry continues to face a highly volatile operating environment. We have to be flexible in dealing with “new norms” and be adaptive to the demands of a rapidly changing operating environment. In 2013, whilst our passenger business was generally robust, fuel prices remained on a high plateau and the cargo market continued to be weak. In addition to responding to these short to medium term difficulties, we are also future-proofing our business by continuously strengthening ourselves in different ways — with our fleet, the network, flight frequencies, our products and services, the loyalty and Frequent Flyer programmes, and importantly, our team of people. Specifically, Cathay Pacific continued to invest in modernising our aircrafts, which will enable us to reduce fuel usage, carbon emissions, and noise pollution to the local community, and hence creating value for our stakeholders.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that our investments are going to pay dividends in the long run, and together with our outstanding team which is the best in the business, our best days lie ahead.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/ceo-signature.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\n<strong>Ivan Chu</strong>\r\nChief Executive', 'Message from the Chief Executive', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '26-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-18 03:19:04', '2014-07-18 03:19:04', '', 26, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/26-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This year’s theme for our Sustainable Development Report, Making the Connection, is particularly relevant.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 alone, over 29 million people travelled with Cathay Pacific and Dragonair between the 140 destinations offered by our global network.\r\nAcross the whole industry, over 3 billion passengers travelled by air in 2013. Once considered a luxury, flying has become more accessible, with nearly 50,000 routes served in total globally.\r\n\r\nAviation not only provides jobs, trade links, connectivity and tourism. It also provides support for sustainable development through air travel, whether by supporting the transportation of sustainable agricultural products, connecting the global supply chains, providing vital lifelines to many remote communities including small island states and offering rapid disaster response. In essence, aviation is the real “world wide web”<a class="note-link" href="#note1">1</a>.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making physical connections, this year’s theme reflects our desire for deeper engagement with our stakeholders. Since our first Environmental Report in 1996, we have been bringing our stakeholders on board this journey by progressively reporting on our environmental performance more transparently and comprehensively. In doing so, we wanted stakeholders to know where we stand on the issues that are of concern to them, our plans for addressing the impacts of our operations, how we are progressing, and how they can help us improve our performance. It is about connecting our stakeholders and our sustainability issues closer together.\r\n\r\nThe industry continues to balance the dual challenges of sustained high price of jet fuel and weak air cargo demand with the need to remain profitable against the backdrop of extremely thin margins. We believe that tackling these challenges successfully and effectively would put us on the trajectory to creating value for our stakeholders. It is about connecting our operational impacts to value creation.\r\n<div class="row quote-photo-container clearfix">\r\n<div class="col-sm-4 quote-photo"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/john-slosar.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n<div class="col-sm-8 quote-text">\r\n<blockquote>“Building an economically efficient and sustainable platform is now the order of the day, and this of course involves a large number of stakeholders and is indeed a huge challenge.

These five priority areas enable us to set specific targets and move purposefully toward our goal. They also encompass the key components of who we are and how we work. In 2012, we launched our 20/20 SD commitments, and each commitment is highlighted under each of the five priority areas.\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-sm-9"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/approach-to-sustainable-development.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>Our Sustainable Development Targets</h2>\r\nAlthough the 20 commitments are being implemented by different business functions, and, in turn, address different stakeholder priorities, they all promote Cathay Pacific’s sustainable development targets which cut across the group’s activities and aim to:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Reduce our overall emissions;</li>\r\n	<li>Offer sustainably sourced products and services to our customers; and</li>\r\n	<li>Ensure our community programmes are relevant and effective to the beneficiaries.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis is what the above three targets mean to us:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n<h3>Reducing Emissions</h3>\r\nAccording to the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/aviation/index.php?idp=68" target="_blank">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) and the <a href="http://www.iea.org/co2highlights/co2highlights.pdf" target="_blank">International Energy Agency</a> (IEA), aviation currently accounts for 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. As aviation grows to meet increasing demand, the IPCC has forecasted that, by 2050, the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions could rise to 3%. While forecasts for 2050 can vary significantly, they highlight a challenge that the aviation industry will face over the next 40 years.\r\n\r\nProjected increases in our emissions cannot be left unchecked, and that is why we are firmly committed to reducing our impacts. The industry has directed significant investment towards addressing the challenge, introducing new technology, better operating procedures and sustainable biofuels.\r\n\r\nWithin Cathay Pacific, aircraft emissions constitute 99% of our overall CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Therefore we have committed to manage our carbon emissions and contribute to global efforts to reduce aviation’s impact on the environment and climate change. In fact, we commit to improving our fuel efficiency by 2% year on year to 2020, which is in line with ICAO’s target for the industry. At the same time, we are actively managing the energy and water impacts of our facilities, vehicle fleet and the equipment we use across our subsidiaries.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about our performance on this target, go to our <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_D1_Climate_Change_Factsheet.pdf">Climate Change factsheet</a> .</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<h3>Offering Sustainably Sourced Products and Minimising Resource Use</h3>\r\nWe continually examine options to reduce resource use throughout our supply chain and to use materials from sustainable sources (such as Forestry Stewardship Council and Marine Stewardship Council-certified products, or recycled materials). We ensure our procurement team understand the requirements of our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct, so they can, in turn, ensure our suppliers comply with our standards. We also look for opportunities to improve recycling and waste management across all facets of our operations.

(148, 1, '2014-07-18 05:23:22', '2014-07-18 05:23:22', 'One of Cathay Pacific’s safety goals is zero accidents and zero ''high risk'' incidents. In 2013, there were no events classified as accidents, which was the same as in 2012. There were eight ''high risk'' safety incidents in 2013, compared to one in 2012. Five of these were related to loading or load integrity on the freighter fleet. Another one was the collapse of an airport passenger bridge at the Hong Kong International Airport. The remaining two were “near misses” with a military aircraft in Chinese airspace and a passenger smuggling lithium batteries in a suitcase from Hong Kong. These events were investigated by the Corporate Safety Department (CSD), with a view to learning and preventing recurrence.\r\n\r\nThe above ‘high risk’ events have all been investigated as far as possible by CSD. Mitigating actions have been put in place to prevent any repeat occurrences. For example, investigations into the carriage of lithium batteries in checked baggage discovered that this was occurring on certain routes. Working with airport security, these flights were targeted for increased baggage screening which resulted in several shipments of batteries being discovered, off loaded, confiscated and the person responsible warned about their conduct.\r\n\r\nThere were 0.64 ''moderate risk'' safety incidents per 1,000 sectors in 2013, a reduction from 0.72 events/1000 sectors in 2012. The majority of these were cargo/ramp related events on the ground, in part, the result of a maturing reporting culture. CSD view any increase in reporting as a healthy positive indicator of a safety culture, where staff feel comfortable reporting to the company in order to facilitate safety improvement. It demonstrates an excellent pro-active reporting culture.\r\n<h3>Safety Incidents</h3>\r\n<img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/safety_incidents.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nDuring 2013, we further developed and improved our risk-based Safety Management System (SMS) by introducing a new Safety Performance Indicator (SPI) and Risk Index Score (RIS) methodology. These are shown in the <a href="#">Safety Key Performance Indicators (KPI) table</a>. Where possible these safety metrics are benchmarked against other airlines, industry performance and best practices.\r\n\r\nCathay Pacific has a very complex passenger and freighter network with pilots based all over the world living in vastly different time zones. This has created a very challenging task in pilot rostering and fatigue management. Consequently, managing pilot fatigue risk is an important component of Cathay Pacific''s SMS. Therefore, during 2013, we continued to develop and mature the Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) that was established in 2011. Cathay Pacific’s FRMS experience is much sought after by industry groups. In 2013, CX continued to serve on the International Air Transport Association (IATA) FRMS Taskforce and on a panel at the international FRMS Forum.\r\n\r\nDragonair continued to implement the KA FRMS in 2013, which has been fully incorporated into Dragonair’s SMS. The Cockpit Fatigue Report was updated to allow crew to provide more information. Reporting of fatigue increased slightly throughout 2013 and changes were made to rostering to address issues identified via fatigue reporting. Regular issues of the ‘FRMS Newsletter to Pilots’ kept flight crew informed on the KA FRMS. KA will commence roster analysis using the FAST fatigue software in 2014.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the work to improve Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and reduce crew and staff injury, the overall Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) has stabilised following a slight reduction. In 2013, we conducted a safety campaign called “Think Safe”, which is our injury preventive initiative for cabin crew handling passenger’s baggage. Our cabin crew are not encouraged to handle passenger’s baggage for OHS reasons. However, should they be required to assist passengers with special needs (such as passengers who are frail or infirm, the elderly, minors travelling alone and passengers travelling with infants or small children), they should always assess the weight of the baggage by conducting a “lift check” before any manual handling. If the weight of the baggage is beyond their capacity, they should always seek assistance from a fellow cabin crew or try an alternative such as breaking the load, or having the baggage offloaded to the cargo hold. It is important that our cabin crew look after themselves whilst providing excellent service. More intervention to drive injuries lower is planned for 2014.\r\n\r\nOur parent company, Swire Pacific Limited, issued a Transportation Safety Policy in 2013 to protect staff when travelling on company transport. It is applicable to staff and crew buses operated by Hong Kong Airport Services (HAS), a Cathay Pacific subsidiary, as well as the buses provided by our contractor, Kwoon Chung Limited.\r\n<h3>Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (%)</h3>\r\n<img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/lost_time_injury_frequency_rate.jpg" alt="" />', 'Updates for 2013', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '121-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-18 05:23:22', '2014-07-18 05:23:22', '', 121, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/121-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

For example, investigations into the carriage of lithium batteries in checked baggage discovered that this was occurring on certain routes. Working with airport security, these flights were targeted for increased baggage screening which resulted in several shipments of batteries being discovered, off loaded, confiscated and the person responsible warned about their conduct.\r\n\r\nThere were 0.64 ''moderate risk'' safety incidents per 1,000 sectors in 2013, a reduction from 0.72 events/1000 sectors in 2012. The majority of these were cargo/ramp related events on the ground, in part, the result of a maturing reporting culture. CSD view any increase in reporting as a healthy positive indicator of a safety culture, where staff feel comfortable reporting to the company in order to facilitate safety improvement. It demonstrates an excellent pro-active reporting culture.\r\n<h3>Safety Incidents</h3>\r\n<img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/safety_incidents.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nDuring 2013, we further developed and improved our risk-based Safety Management System (SMS) by introducing a new Safety Performance Indicator (SPI) and Risk Index Score (RIS) methodology. These are shown in the <a href="#">Safety Key Performance Indicators (KPI) table</a>. Where possible these safety metrics are benchmarked against other airlines, industry performance and best practices.\r\n\r\nCathay Pacific has a very complex passenger and freighter network with pilots based all over the world living in vastly different time zones. This has created a very challenging task in pilot rostering and fatigue management. Consequently, managing pilot fatigue risk is an important component of Cathay Pacific''s SMS. Therefore, during 2013, we continued to develop and mature the Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) that was established in 2011. Cathay Pacific’s FRMS experience is much sought after by industry groups. In 2013, CX continued to serve on the International Air Transport Association (IATA) FRMS Taskforce and on a panel at the international FRMS Forum.\r\n\r\nDragonair continued to implement the KA FRMS in 2013, which has been fully incorporated into Dragonair’s SMS. The Cockpit Fatigue Report was updated to allow crew to provide more information. Reporting of fatigue increased slightly throughout 2013 and changes were made to rostering to address issues identified via fatigue reporting. Regular issues of the ‘FRMS Newsletter to Pilots’ kept flight crew informed on the KA FRMS. KA will commence roster analysis using the FAST fatigue software in 2014.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the work to improve Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and reduce crew and staff injury, the overall Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) has stabilised following a slight reduction. In 2013, we conducted a safety campaign called “Think Safe”, which is our injury preventive initiative for cabin crew handling passenger’s baggage. Our cabin crew are not encouraged to handle passenger’s baggage for OHS reasons. However, should they be required to assist passengers with special needs (such as passengers who are frail or infirm, the elderly, minors travelling alone and passengers travelling with infants or small children), they should always assess the weight of the baggage by conducting a “lift check” before any manual handling. If the weight of the baggage is beyond their capacity, they should always seek assistance from a fellow cabin crew or try an alternative such as breaking the load, or having the baggage offloaded to the cargo hold. It is important that our cabin crew look after themselves whilst providing excellent service. More intervention to drive injuries lower is planned for 2014.\r\n\r\nOur parent company, Swire Pacific Limited, issued a Transportation Safety Policy in 2013 to protect staff when travelling on company transport. It is applicable to staff and crew buses operated by Hong Kong Airport Services (HAS), a Cathay Pacific subsidiary, as well as the buses provided by our contractor, Kwoon Chung Limited.\r\n<h3>Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (%)</h3>\r\n<img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/lost_time_injury_frequency_rate.jpg" alt="" />', 'Updates for 2013', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '121-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-18 07:00:42', '2014-07-18 07:00:42', '', 121, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/121-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Climate change has been a material issue for us for a long time, and stakeholders recognise that we have been addressing this as a priority, but at the same time, expect us to adopt targets that exceed the industry ones.\r\n\r\nThere is an expectation for us to further enhance transparency and communication around our climate change approach, especially with staff, and for us to engage more proactively and publicly on this issue.

(171, 1, '2014-07-18 10:41:51', '2014-07-18 10:41:51', '<h2>Our Journey to Sustainable Development</h2>\r\nIn 1980, Cathay Pacific became one of the first airlines in the world to implement fuel efficiency measures — enabling us to undertake the first nonstop flight from Hong Kong to London. We then implemented these on our long-haul flights beginning with our nonstop flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver in 1982, and applied this approach throughout our fleet and worldwide routes.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Swire Group, a statement in 1989 by our honorary life president and former Chairman, Sir Adrian Swire, continues to inspire the company’s direction:\r\n<blockquote>“As a Group we should always seek to be ahead of legislation rather than reacting to it: that even if the environmentally “clean” way of doing something is more expensive and therefore on the face of it uneconomic, we should always, regardless of mandatory legislation, have a close look at the overall feasibility of adopting such a practice, both from the point of view of general public good and enlightened self-interest.”</blockquote>\r\nThis approach defines what sustainable development means to us – it is about applying long term thinking in the business, doing the right thing by the environment and our stakeholders, which results in long term success and a sustained existence.\r\n\r\nCathay Pacific’s current programme of CSR activities began back in 1991 with the launch of Change for Good, although we already had community activities since the 1970’s, with the purpose of giving back to Hong Kong and to the communities in which we operate in.\r\n\r\nOn employee remuneration, we became one of the first companies in Hong Kong to provide flexible benefit schemes to our employees and formal management training programmes for pilots, engineers and general managers.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, we became one of the first Hong Kong companies to publish a voluntary publicly available Environmental Report for our stakeholders, which eventually evolved into our first Sustainable Development Report in 2009.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, with the support of various departments, we launched our Sustainable Development Strategy 20/20 commitments.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, thanks to the concerted effort of our colleagues, we were one of the few airlines and Hong Kong companies to be listed simultaneously in the FTSE4Good, Dow Jones Sustainability Index Asia-Pacific, and the Hang Seng Sustainability Index. We were also listed as a constituent of the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index Asia ex-Japan category under the Carbon Disclosure Project.\r\n\r\nOur journey has not been easy, but it has been rewarding –since 1980, we have experienced our record-breaking profit years and our first profit loss; we have gone through Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS); a number of economic downturns; to record highs in Hong Kong’s economy. Throughout this time, we have seen our sustainability commitments mature – starting from looking purely at environmental issues; to include social issues, and now beginning to integrate environmental, social and economic issues – the basic components of “sustainability”.\r\n\r\nThis year’s report highlights how far we have come, but also illustrates how much work still needs to be done. There is still some way to go before reaching our goal of fully embedding the value and practice of sustainability into how we conduct day-to-day business. In the 1980s, sustainability issues were not yet considered a priority for the world at large. Sustainability issues have become far more complex, the solutions need to be more innovative, and the actions need to be taken more urgently. While we have made significant progress, we need to work faster.\r\n\r\nThe aviation industry faces many challenges: rising fuel costs, access to diminishing natural resources, limited talent pool, increasing and uncertain regulations, and a fragile economic recovery. We continue to take sustainability seriously and place it high on our agenda as our success as a company depends on the success of society – we need thriving economies, sufficient sustainable natural resources and the right people to drive our future growth. We know this is not something we can achieve by ourselves. For the past few years we have been working with our partners – our stakeholders – employees, regulators, government, customers, suppliers, communities, non-governmental organisations, and other specialists – to make not only our vision possible, but to make our collective goal of connectivity sustainable for the long term.\r\n\r\nWe invite you, our stakeholders, and our readers to join us in making these sustainable connections possible.', 'Approach to Sustainable Development', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '28-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-18 10:41:51', '2014-07-18 10:41:51', '', 28, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/28-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This is an absolute emissions reduction from 2012 of 1.7%, or 0.27 million tCO<sub>2</sub>. A reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was also recorded in relation to our capacity (grammes/ATK - available tonne kilometre) and traffic volume carried (grammes/RTK - revenue tonne kilometre). This improvement in our fuel efficiency is in line with our expectations as we continued to upgrade and modernise our fleet while retiring less fuel-efficient aircraft. Since 1998, our CO<sub>2</sub> efficiency in relation to ATK and RTK has improved by 12.2% and 19.3% respectively.\r\n\r\n<img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/ghg_emissions.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nFuel efficiency achievements in 2013 included:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Fleet modernisation by taking delivery of five Airbus A330-300s; nine Boeing 777-300ERs, and five Boeing 747-8Fs and retiring five Boeing 747-400 aircraft.</li>\r\n	<li>Participated in the Asia and Pacific Initiative to Reduce Emissions (ASPIRE) programme, operating four demonstration flights on 20 November 2013 from Hong Kong to Sydney, Melbourne, San Francisco and Anchorage respectively.

Cathay Pacific’s participation in the Aviation Global Deal and the IATA Climate Change Task Force played a significant role in the process as it helped to gather support between airlines and within IATA for the first comprehensive agreement on climate change for any global sector.\r\n<h2>European Union Emissions Trading Scheme</h2>\r\nFollowing the 38th ICAO Assembly, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/articles/news_2013101601_en.htm" target="_blank">European Union (EU) announced its proposal</a> to amend the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) so that aviation emissions would be covered for the part of flights that takes place in European airspace. We believe the proposal is not consistent with the resolution of the 38th ICAO Assembly, where no prior consultation was conducted. The continual amendments to the regulation also added to legislative uncertainty and posed an additional layer of complexity for airlines striving to meet regulatory requirements in all markets they operate in. Despite our opposition, we have been making all the necessary preparations for full compliance with the EU ETS regulation.\r\n\r\n<img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/global_efforts.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h2>Contribution to Climate Change Science</h2>\r\nIn 2013, one of our Airbus A330-300 aircraft was the first of its type to be equipped with <a href="http://www.iagos.org/" target="_blank">In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS)</a> scientific instruments following the certification of the system on the Airbus A330. It has been deployed primarily on Australian and Middle East routes from Hong Kong to complement other similarly equipped commercial aircraft operating on other routes around the world. Data is transmitted from the aircraft on a daily basis to the IAGOS central database for access by science and policy users, including the provision of real time data for weather prediction, air quality forecasting and climate models.  More information can be found on their website at <a href="http://www.iagos.org" target="_blank">www.iagos.org</a>.\r\n<div class="row two-col-with-gap">\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-left"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/CXW_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-right"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/CXW_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>FLY<em>greener</em> carbon offset</h2>\r\nPassengers continued to offset the emissions from their flights via <a href="http://www.cathaypacific.com/FLY&lt;em&gt;greener&lt;/em&gt;" target="_blank">FLY<em>greener</em></a>, Cathay Pacific’s carbon offset programme.

Following a review in 2012 of plastic material usage throughout our operations, we decided to focus our efforts on single use disposable items as this is an area where we believe there is potential for reductions. We are looking at using alternative packaging material instead of plastic, as well as engaging with our suppliers to reduce excessive packaging. We will report in more detail on this next year.\r\n\r\nWe introduced fast-growing bamboo wood in the renovation of our flagship lounge at the Hong International Airport, The Cabin, both for wall and furniture finishes. There is also a 40 metre long eucalyptus wood feature wall in the First Class section of the lounge, as part of our commitment to adopting green building standards or principles in our buildings, offices, and lounges.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Pioneer Floor Programme, we completed the renovation of a section of our headquarter building at Cathay City. In addition to reviewing workplace settings, one of the project objectives is to reduce our environmental impact. Initiatives have been implemented in terms of resource use and waste management, such as managing waste construction materials, using reusable carpet flooring, retaining and reusing partitioning walls, the existing ceiling system, and other existing base materials.\r\n<h2>Food waste</h2>\r\nThe Cathay Pacific Group, through Cathay Pacific Airways, Dragonair and Cathay Pacific Catering Services, serves around 93,400 meals per day. We recognise that food waste is unavoidably created every day. In addition to having implemented a number of measures to reduce food waste where we can on reusing food offcuts, recycling used cooking oil, and better flight meal planning, in 2013, we joined efforts for the first time with Food Angel, a food rescue programme in Hong Kong. They came to collect and repackage surplus meat and vegetables from Cathay City which would then be distributed to underprivileged communities in Hong Kong.

Following a review in 2012 of plastic material usage throughout our operations, we decided to focus our efforts on single use disposable items as this is an area where we believe there is potential for reductions. We are looking at using alternative packaging material instead of plastic, as well as engaging with our suppliers to reduce excessive packaging. We will report in more detail on this next year.\r\n\r\nWe introduced fast-growing bamboo wood in the renovation of our flagship lounge at the Hong International Airport, The Cabin, both for wall and furniture finishes. There is also a 40 metre long eucalyptus wood feature wall in the First Class section of the lounge, as part of our commitment to adopting green building standards or principles in our buildings, offices, and lounges.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Pioneer Floor Programme, we completed the renovation of a section of our headquarter building at Cathay City. In addition to reviewing workplace settings, one of the project objectives is to reduce our environmental impact. Initiatives have been implemented in terms of resource use and waste management, such as managing waste construction materials, using reusable carpet flooring, retaining and reusing partitioning walls, the existing ceiling system, and other existing base materials.\r\n<h2>Food waste</h2>\r\nThe Cathay Pacific Group, through Cathay Pacific Airways, Dragonair and Cathay Pacific Catering Services, serves around 93,400 meals per day. We recognise that food waste is unavoidably created every day. In addition to having implemented a number of measures to reduce food waste where we can on reusing food offcuts, recycling used cooking oil, and better flight meal planning, in 2013, we joined efforts for the first time with Food Angel, a food rescue programme in Hong Kong. They came to collect and repackage surplus meat and vegetables from Cathay City which would then be distributed to underprivileged communities in Hong Kong. Between August to December, 760 kg of food was donated.', 'Updates for 2013', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '181-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-19 07:32:05', '2014-07-19 07:32:05', '', 181, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/181-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We envision a sustainable supply chain within the Cathay Pacific Group, and working with our suppliers is key to delivering products and services to our customers sustainably.</p>\r\nWe work with our suppliers on a supply chain sustainability compliance process as part of our risk management process. Many of our suppliers are companies who also report publicly on their sustainability performance and hold similar values towards corporate responsibility as ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn order to deliver products and services that are sustainably sourced, we need to work with our suppliers. Developing a sustainable supply chain is a challenge due to the large amount of items we purchase, each with varying specifications. In some cases, we may not have leverage on all our suppliers and have limited influence on the sustainability attributes of these materials. Moreover, our specifications need to meet very strict safety standards, particularly if we are taking these items onboard. We are determined to find solutions to these challenges:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>We participate in best practice sharing sessions locally and internationally: Cathay Pacific chaired the Swire Sustainable Purchasing Working Group between 2007 and 2013, which looks at synergies within the Swire Group in embedding sustainable purchasing practices in the Swire Pacific companies. We were a founding member of the Hong Kong Green Purchasing Charter in 2008. In 2013, we were also one of the founding participants of the inaugural Sustainable Lifestyles Working Group launched by non-profit sustainability organisation BSR and sustainability communications firm Futerra.</li>\r\n	<li>We trial and use alternative materials and implement these across the Cathay Pacific Group: We often assess the performance of alternative materials.  Once it passes the trial phase, we implement the material across the whole Group. For example, when we decided to switch all office paper to sustainably-sourced material, we assessed different options from recycled paper to paper made from FSC sources. Since our initial purchase of sustainable office paper in 2008, currently the majority of office paper, marketing paraphernalia in Hong Kong, training materials, inflight magazines and team newsletters have switched to FSC or recycled paper.</li>\r\n	<li>We are developing guidelines and sustainable specifications for a number of items: We developed a number of guidelines that list out the sustainable specifications we need to consider in our purchases. We now have guidelines for airport lounges, IT equipment, paper, plastic and printing. We aim to develop more guidelines to support decision-making with our purchasing team.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Sustainable Purchasing</h2>\r\nOur purchasing practices are set at the highest professional and ethical standards. Most of the purchasing requirements for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair are managed by the Airline Purchasing and Aircraft Trading Department. In addition to our anti-bribery expectations with all our staff, we require our purchasing staff to comply with our additional anti-bribery guidelines outlined in our Purchasing Ethics Policy.\r\n\r\nWe aim to encourage our suppliers to improve on their sustainability practices through capacity building and sharing knowledge on best practices as our approach to sustainable procurement. Our purchasing teams understand the need to consider sustainable purchasing and responsible supply chain practices in buying decisions. We require our suppliers to provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their progress in achieving our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct objectives.\r\n<h2>Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct</h2>\r\nSince the launch of our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct in 2007, suppliers to Cathay Pacific must provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their progress toward achieving our objectives contained in this Code. These include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Legal and regulatory compliance</li>\r\n	<li>Environmental management</li>\r\n	<li>No use of forced and child labour</li>\r\n	<li>Appropriate compensation and working hours</li>\r\n	<li>Health and safety in the workplace</li>\r\n	<li>No discrimination against employees</li>\r\n	<li>Upholding human rights in the workplace</li>\r\n	<li>Having high ethical standards</li>\r\n	<li>Extending social responsibility to their subcontractors and service providers</li>\r\n	<li>Maintaining documentation and permitting our inspection</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn developing and revising the Code, we took account of the International Labour Organization’s core conventions and other applicable and recognised labour standards, referred and benchmarked against the United Nations Global Compact.\r\n<div class="timeline-container clearfix">\r\n<h3>Timeline for Working with Our Supply Chain</h3>\r\n<div class="clearfix">2006Identified the need for a more coordinated approach to sustainability in our supply chain</div>\r\n<div class="clearfix">2007Developed and launched our Supplier Corporate, Social and Environmental Responsibility Code of ConductFirst questionnaires sent to Hong Kong-based suppliers</div>\r\n<div class="clearfix">2008Launched online tool for suppliers to complete questionnaire regarding their compliance with our Code.

Following a review in 2012 of plastic material usage throughout our operations, we decided to focus our efforts on single use disposable items as this is an area where we believe there is potential for reductions. We are looking at using alternative packaging material instead of plastic, as well as engaging with our suppliers to reduce excessive packaging. We will report in more detail on this next year.\r\n\r\nWe introduced fast-growing bamboo wood in the renovation of our flagship lounge at the Hong International Airport, The Cabin, both for wall and furniture finishes. There is also a 40 metre long eucalyptus wood feature wall in the First Class section of the lounge, as part of our commitment to adopting green building standards or principles in our buildings, offices, and lounges.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Pioneer Floor Programme, we completed the renovation of a section of our headquarter building at Cathay City. In addition to reviewing workplace settings, one of the project objectives is to reduce our environmental impact. Initiatives have been implemented in terms of resource use and waste management, such as managing waste construction materials, using reusable carpet flooring, retaining and reusing partitioning walls, the existing ceiling system, and other existing base materials.\r\n<h2>Food waste</h2>\r\nThe Cathay Pacific Group, through Cathay Pacific Airways, Dragonair and Cathay Pacific Catering Services, serves around 93,400 meals per day. We recognise that food waste is unavoidably created every day. In addition to having implemented a number of measures to reduce food waste where we can on reusing food offcuts, recycling used cooking oil, and better flight meal planning, in 2013, we joined efforts for the first time with Food Angel, a food rescue programme in Hong Kong. They came to collect and repackage surplus meat and vegetables from Cathay City which would then be distributed to underprivileged communities in Hong Kong. Between August to December, 760 kg of food was donated.', 'Updates for 2013', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '181-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-19 08:25:05', '2014-07-19 08:25:05', '', 181, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/181-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We recognize that we have an impact on the destinations to which we fly, and hence we continue to develop and incorporate biodiversity elements into our sustainable development strategy.</p>\r\nConservation has long been a topic of concern for Cathay Pacific. For many years, we have been sponsoring habitat-protection programs within Asia, and working with NGOs from across the region. For instance, working with Friends of the Earth, we provided funding that resulted in the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings around Hong Kong. We also raised nearly HK$8 million from passengers to support conservation initiatives in mainland China through The Nature Conservancy. Partnering with the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Gardens in Hong Kong, we helped reintroduce 609 endangered pig-nosed turtles to Indonesia by donating cargo space and air tickets to the organisation. Cathay Pacific will continue to direct investments in biodiversity conservation as a way to give back to the community.\r\n\r\nIt is important that our inflight meals are sustainably sourced as well. On average, Cathay Pacific and Dragonair serve 75,000 inflight meals everyday to our passengers. Therefore, by adhering to international sustainability standards, we can have a substantial positive impact on the diversity of a wide variety of ecosystems. We have already adopted a Sustainable Food Policy that does not allow the serving of a number of unsustainably produced food items, including shark fin soup, both inflight and at company-paid functions.

Since early 2011, we have been serving fish from sustainable sources in Economy class, initially, from our European ports, and subsequently from our Australian ports. In 2012, this was extended to include flights from North American ports.\r\n\r\nIn line with our Sustainable Development Policy, Cathay Pacific announced in 2012 the decision to implement a restrictive carriage policy that will lead to us only carrying sustainably sourced sharks and shark related products. In addition to the considerable weight of independent science- and research-based data which supported our decision, we believe this is the right thing to do for a company that is committed to sustainability.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, we continued to engage with the global scientific community, including the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Shark Specialist Group (SSG) and TRAFFIC International, an NGO network that monitors wildlife trade, to further review and develop implementation guidelines and procedures for our restrictive cargo policy. Our aim is to compile a framework to help us identify sources of shark and shark products which meet best practice consistent with the principles of sustainability in fisheries management, in order for us to effectively implement our policy. While this has been the more challenging path than an outright ban, we believe this is consistent with the principles of sustainable development.

(220, 1, '2014-07-20 09:08:50', '2014-07-20 09:08:50', '<p class="intro">Our suppliers are our partners — we work with over 1,000 of them globally, dealing with purchases from aircraft and fuel to office supplies and uniforms — across the 140 destinations we fly to. We envision a sustainable supply chain within the Cathay Pacific Group, and working with our suppliers is key to delivering products and services to our customers sustainably.</p>\r\nWe work with our suppliers on a supply chain sustainability compliance process as part of our risk management process. Many of our suppliers are companies who also report publicly on their sustainability performance and hold similar values towards corporate responsibility as ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn order to deliver products and services that are sustainably sourced, we need to work with our suppliers. Developing a sustainable supply chain is a challenge due to the large amount of items we purchase, each with varying specifications. In some cases, we may not have leverage on all our suppliers and have limited influence on the sustainability attributes of these materials. Moreover, our specifications need to meet very strict safety standards, particularly if we are taking these items onboard. We are determined to find solutions to these challenges:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>We participate in best practice sharing sessions locally and internationally: Cathay Pacific chaired the Swire Sustainable Purchasing Working Group between 2007 and 2013, which looks at synergies within the Swire Group in embedding sustainable purchasing practices in the Swire Pacific companies. We were a founding member of the Hong Kong Green Purchasing Charter in 2008. In 2013, we were also one of the founding participants of the inaugural Sustainable Lifestyles Working Group launched by non-profit sustainability organisation BSR and sustainability communications firm Futerra.</li>\r\n	<li>We trial and use alternative materials and implement these across the Cathay Pacific Group: We often assess the performance of alternative materials.  Once it passes the trial phase, we implement the material across the whole Group. For example, when we decided to switch all office paper to sustainably-sourced material, we assessed different options from recycled paper to paper made from FSC sources. Since our initial purchase of sustainable office paper in 2008, currently the majority of office paper, marketing paraphernalia in Hong Kong, training materials, inflight magazines and team newsletters have switched to FSC or recycled paper.</li>\r\n	<li>We are developing guidelines and sustainable specifications for a number of items: We developed a number of guidelines that list out the sustainable specifications we need to consider in our purchases. We now have guidelines for airport lounges, IT equipment, paper, plastic and printing. We aim to develop more guidelines to support decision-making with our purchasing team.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Sustainable Purchasing</h2>\r\nOur purchasing practices are set at the highest professional and ethical standards. Most of the purchasing requirements for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair are managed by the Airline Purchasing and Aircraft Trading Department. In addition to our anti-bribery expectations with all our staff, we require our purchasing staff to comply with our additional anti-bribery guidelines outlined in our Purchasing Ethics Policy.\r\n\r\nWe aim to encourage our suppliers to improve on their sustainability practices through capacity building and sharing knowledge on best practices as our approach to sustainable procurement. Our purchasing teams understand the need to consider sustainable purchasing and responsible supply chain practices in buying decisions. We require our suppliers to provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their progress in achieving our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct objectives.\r\n<h2>Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct</h2>\r\nSince the launch of our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct in 2007, suppliers to Cathay Pacific must provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their progress toward achieving our objectives contained in this Code. These include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Legal and regulatory compliance</li>\r\n	<li>Environmental management</li>\r\n	<li>No use of forced and child labour</li>\r\n	<li>Appropriate compensation and working hours</li>\r\n	<li>Health and safety in the workplace</li>\r\n	<li>No discrimination against employees</li>\r\n	<li>Upholding human rights in the workplace</li>\r\n	<li>Having high ethical standards</li>\r\n	<li>Extending social responsibility to their subcontractors and service providers</li>\r\n	<li>Maintaining documentation and permitting our inspection</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn developing and revising the Code, we took account of the International Labour Organization’s core conventions and other applicable and recognised labour standards, referred and benchmarked against the United Nations Global Compact.\r\n<div class="timeline-container clearfix">\r\n<h3>Timeline for Working with Our Supply Chain</h3>\r\n<div class="clearfix">2006Identified the need for a more coordinated approach to sustainability in our supply chain</div>\r\n<div class="clearfix">2007Developed and launched our Supplier Corporate, Social and Environmental Responsibility Code of ConductFirst questionnaires sent to Hong Kong-based suppliers\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="clearfix">2008Launched online tool for suppliers to complete questionnaire regarding their compliance with our Code.

We recognize that we have an impact on the destinations to which we fly, and hence we continue to develop and incorporate biodiversity elements into our sustainable development strategy.</p>\r\nConservation has long been a topic of concern for Cathay Pacific. For many years, we have been sponsoring habitat-protection programs within Asia, and working with NGOs from across the region. For instance, working with Friends of the Earth, we provided funding that resulted in the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings around Hong Kong. We also raised nearly HK$8 million from passengers to support conservation initiatives in mainland China through The Nature Conservancy. Partnering with the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Gardens in Hong Kong, we helped reintroduce 609 endangered pig-nosed turtles to Indonesia by donating cargo space and air tickets to the organisation. Cathay Pacific will continue to direct investments in biodiversity conservation as a way to give back to the community.\r\n\r\nIt is important that our inflight meals are sustainably sourced as well. On average, Cathay Pacific and Dragonair serve 75,000 inflight meals everyday to our passengers. Therefore, by adhering to international sustainability standards, we can have a substantial positive impact on the diversity of a wide variety of ecosystems. We have already adopted a Sustainable Food Policy that does not allow the serving of a number of unsustainably produced food items, including shark fin soup, both inflight and at company-paid functions. Since 2011, we have been serving fish from sustainable sources, such as those that are Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified, in Economy Class on all our flights departing from Europe. We follow a similar policy for fish served in Economy Class on flights from Australian and North American ports.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about what the Cathay Pacific Group has been doing to support habitat-protection programs and adopt a strategy that incorporates biodiversity considerations into our daily operations, go to our <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_G1_Biodiversity_Factsheet" target="_blank">Biodiversity factsheet</a>.', 'Biodiversity Matters', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '208-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-20 09:14:35', '2014-07-20 09:14:35', '', 208, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/208-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Below are some highlights from 2013:\r\n<h3>All staff</h3>\r\nIn 2013, we proceeded to the next stage of We Suggest, a sustainability-themed ideas competition for our staff around the world. A team-building offsite session was held in Kunming for the five shortlisted finalist teams to prepare and present their ideas to the judging panel. In the end, the CX Manchester Cargo Team won the competition with their suggestion of removing the 88 inch pallet stops on cargo aircraft. The removal of these pallet stops would lead to a decrease in weight, fuel use and ultimately carbon emissions. The relevant departments are reviewing the proposals in more detail.\r\n<div class="row two-col-with-gap">\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-left"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/kunming-team-1.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-right"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/kunming-team-2.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\nWe organised our version of Earth Hour’s I Will If You Will campaign, where senior managers were asked to pledge an environmental and/or charitable fun act if a certain proportion of their team or colleagues pledged their own environmental acts. Ivan Chu, our COO at the time, pledged to use an electric vehicle instead of his regular company car for a week. Managers from departments and teams in Hong Kong as well as outports joined to rally participation. This event won the “Most Replicable Activity” at the 3rd Swire Sustainable Development Forum, which will then be applied to other Swire operating companies.\r\n<div class="container">\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-sm-8 nopadding"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/team-submissions.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Flight crew</h3>\r\nWe maintain a number of communication channels with our pilots to provide both technical and personal support, as well as information dissemination. These included forums and auditorium sessions.\r\n\r\nAt Cathay Pacific, we started negotiations with the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association (HKAOA) in late 2013, which are still ongoing. These are primarily negotiations related to pay and rostering, with other topics also included. We also continued with bargaining sessions in Australia working towards our first Enterprise Agreement.\r\n\r\nAt Dragonair, work is in progress on various fronts including Agreements that are periodically reviewed, such as Rostering Practices. Moreover, crew member representatives work closely with Dragonair on various Committees to provide feedback on meal selections, hotels, rostering and scheduling.\r\n<div class="container">\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-sm-8 nopadding"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/flight-crew.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Cabin crew</h3>\r\nIn 2013, Cathay Pacific cabin crew were voted as the “World’s Best Cabin Crew” in the World Airlines Awards run by Skytrax, which was celebrated extensively both at CX City and at overseas crew bases\r\n<div class="row two-col-with-gap">\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-left"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/decorations-1.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-right"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/decorations-2.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\nThis year, our regular Crew Forums provided support on issues such as crew rostering, lifestyle schemes as well as bringing important issues to management’s attention. Also based on feedback from crew, we introduced the “high hours scheme” where crew who wished to work more hours can opt for it. At the same time, we were trialing a route-specific scheme so crew who wanted to operate on one specific route during a certain month, could do so. The Work-Life Enhancement Leave (WEL) scheme was created especially for cabin crew to provide flexibility in their roster at certain times in their life to better manage their work and lifestyle needs, and one which allowed crew to balance and fulfill their work and personal responsibilities at the same time. This proved to be very popular, and was rolled out as a permanent scheme in 2013.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, new websites and mobile phone applications exclusively for Cathay Pacific Cabin Crew and Dragonair Crew were launched.  “iCrew” for Cathay Pacific and “i-KA” for Dragonair were designed to help crew quickly access relevant and up-to-date news and information using a computer, smartphone or tablet, no matter where they are in the world. The aim was to facilitate swifter communication and create a platform for better engagement for a non-office based workforce.\r\n\r\nThis year, over 200 Dragonair cabin crew competed in the first ever Dragonair Charity Singing Contest in support of community flights to Kathmandu, Nepal. Thirty finalists and their families were selected to join the ISD management team and local ground staff on two trips to Nepal in July and August. There, they visited an elderly home and three orphanages, including one for children infected with HIV.\r\n<div class="container">\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-sm-8 nopadding"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/kathmandu-visit.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\nBoth last year and this year, enormous team spirit was displayed through a flash mob performance at the HKIA and Cathay Pacific City, in support of the charity Operation Santa Claus. Two hundred cabin crew, 40 HKIA ground staff and four pilots volunteered in 2013, raising HK$380,000.\r\n<div class="row two-col-with-gap">\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-left"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/icrew.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-right"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/flash-mob.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Recruitment</h3>\r\nA total of 1,750 flight crew, cabin crew and ground staff in both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair were recruited to support the expansion of our business.\r\n\r\nWe also launched an IT Trainee Programme to support the growth of our IT-enabled activities.\r\n<h3>Training and Development</h3>\r\nWe promote a culture of continuous learning. Our staff are responsible for their own professional and career development and the company supports this by investing heavily in extensive formal training, online learning, seminars and forums. A strong emphasis is also placed on personal development. A series of flight attendants’ workshops were introduced to provide developmental opportunities for those who have completed four years of service. These workshops focused on enhancing interaction styles, especially in terms of cultural sensitivity.\r\n\r\nWe continued with the Inflight Service Managers (ISM) workshops and annual forums. In 2013, modules included workshops dealing with unruly behaviour inflight with de-escalation techniques.

These are primarily negotiations related to pay and rostering, with other topics also included. We also continued with bargaining sessions in Australia working towards our first Enterprise Agreement.\n\nAt Dragonair, work is in progress on various fronts including Agreements that are periodically reviewed, such as Rostering Practices.

At the same time, we were trialing a route-specific scheme so crew who wanted to operate on one specific route during a certain month, could do so. The Work-Life Enhancement Leave (WEL) scheme was created especially for cabin crew to provide flexibility in their roster at certain times in their life to better manage their work and lifestyle needs, and one which allowed crew to balance and fulfill their work and personal responsibilities at the same time.

Moreover, crew member representatives work closely with Dragonair on various Committees to provide feedback on meal selections, hotels, rostering and scheduling.\r\n<div class="container">\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-sm-8 nopadding"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/flight-crew.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Cabin crew</h3>\r\nIn 2013, Cathay Pacific cabin crew were voted as the “World’s Best Cabin Crew” in the World Airlines Awards run by Skytrax, which was celebrated extensively both at CX City and at overseas crew bases\r\n<div class="row two-col-with-gap">\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-left"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/decorations-1.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-right"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/decorations-2.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\nThis year, our regular Crew Forums provided support on issues such as crew rostering, lifestyle schemes as well as bringing important issues to management’s attention. Also based on feedback from crew, we introduced the “high hours scheme” where crew who wished to work more hours can opt for it. At the same time, we were trialing a route-specific scheme so crew who wanted to operate on one specific route during a certain month, could do so. The Work-Life Enhancement Leave (WEL) scheme was created especially for cabin crew to provide flexibility in their roster at certain times in their life to better manage their work and lifestyle needs, and one which allowed crew to balance and fulfill their work and personal responsibilities at the same time. This proved to be very popular, and was rolled out as a permanent scheme in 2013.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, new websites and mobile phone applications exclusively for Cathay Pacific Cabin Crew and Dragonair Crew were launched.  “iCrew” for Cathay Pacific and “i-KA” for Dragonair were designed to help crew quickly access relevant and up-to-date news and information using a computer, smartphone or tablet, no matter where they are in the world. The aim was to facilitate swifter communication and create a platform for better engagement for a non-office based workforce.\r\n\r\nThis year, over 200 Dragonair cabin crew competed in the first ever Dragonair Charity Singing Contest in support of community flights to Kathmandu, Nepal. Thirty finalists and their families were selected to join the ISD management team and local ground staff on two trips to Nepal in July and August. There, they visited an elderly home and three orphanages, including one for children infected with HIV.\r\n<div class="container">\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-sm-8 nopadding"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/kathmandu-visit.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\nBoth last year and this year, enormous team spirit was displayed through a flash mob performance at the HKIA and Cathay Pacific City, in support of the charity Operation Santa Claus. Two hundred cabin crew, 40 HKIA ground staff and four pilots volunteered in 2013, raising HK$380,000.\r\n<div class="row two-col-with-gap">\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-left"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/icrew.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n<div class="col-sm-6 col-right"><img class="img-responsive nobottomMargin" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/flash-mob.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Recruitment</h3>\r\nA total of 1,750 flight crew, cabin crew and ground staff in both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair were recruited to support the expansion of our business.\r\n\r\nWe also launched an IT Trainee Programme to support the growth of our IT-enabled activities.\r\n<h3>Training and Development</h3>\r\nWe promote a culture of continuous learning. Our staff are responsible for their own professional and career development and the company supports this by investing heavily in extensive formal training, online learning, seminars and forums. A strong emphasis is also placed on personal development. A series of flight attendants’ workshops were introduced to provide developmental opportunities for those who have completed four years of service. These workshops focused on enhancing interaction styles, especially in terms of cultural sensitivity.\r\n\r\nWe continued with the Inflight Service Managers (ISM) workshops and annual forums. In 2013, modules included workshops dealing with unruly behaviour inflight with de-escalation techniques. In addition, voluntary workshops were offered in areas such as wine tasting, servicing the First Class cabin, public address and grooming.\r\n\r\nAt Dragonair, two Mentor Master Classes were organised as the second stage of mentor development. During these sessions, experienced mentors shared and exchanged ideas on improving the mentoring process and the programme itself.', 'Updates for 2013', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '232-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-20 11:21:51', '2014-07-20 11:21:51', '', 232, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/232-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This year’s theme for our Sustainable Development Report, Making the Connection, is particularly relevant.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 alone, over 29 million people travelled with Cathay Pacific and Dragonair between the 140 destinations offered by our global network.\r\nAcross the whole industry, over 3 billion passengers travelled by air in 2013. Once considered a luxury, flying has become more accessible, with nearly 50,000 routes served in total globally.\r\n\r\nAviation not only provides jobs, trade links, connectivity and tourism. It also provides support for sustainable development through air travel, whether by supporting the transportation of sustainable agricultural products, connecting the global supply chains, providing vital lifelines to many remote communities including small island states and offering rapid disaster response. In essence, aviation is the real “world wide web”<a class="note-link" href="#note1">1</a>.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making physical connections, this year’s theme reflects our desire for deeper engagement with our stakeholders. Since our first Environmental Report in 1996, we have been bringing our stakeholders on board this journey by progressively reporting on our environmental performance more transparently and comprehensively. In doing so, we wanted stakeholders to know where we stand on the issues that are of concern to them, our plans for addressing the impacts of our operations, how we are progressing, and how they can help us improve our performance. It is about connecting our stakeholders and our sustainability issues closer together.\r\n\r\nThe industry continues to balance the dual challenges of sustained high price of jet fuel and weak air cargo demand with the need to remain profitable against the backdrop of extremely thin margins. We believe that tackling these challenges successfully and effectively would put us on the trajectory to creating value for our stakeholders. It is about connecting our operational impacts to value creation.\r\n<div class="row quote-photo-container clearfix">\r\n<div class="col-sm-4 quote-photo"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/john-slosar.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n<div class="col-sm-8 quote-text">\r\n<blockquote>“Building an economically efficient and sustainable platform is now the order of the day, and this of course involves a large number of stakeholders and is indeed a huge challenge.

Many of our suppliers are companies who also report publicly on their sustainability performance and hold similar values towards corporate responsibility as ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn order to deliver products and services that are sustainably sourced, we need to work with our suppliers. Developing a sustainable supply chain is a challenge due to the large amount of items we purchase, each with varying specifications.

While we were seen by our stakeholders as having improved in this area, they expect to see continued action on this urgent issue.</p>\r\nIn particular, our staff are concerned about what they can do in the working environment, for example flight and cabin crew wanted to see more being done on inflight waste, while our ground staff wanted to see more done in the offices and airports. This is a positive sign, as we are seeing our staff more willing to be involved in reducing our use of resources and increasing recycling and re-using where we can. This is encouraging as a lot of our resource and waste management initiatives can only be achieved with the support of our staff both inflight and on the ground.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, we have received considerable attention on our use of plastics inflight – this was consistent amongst our different stakeholders – from passengers, staff and environmental organisations. We have provided a detailed section in <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_E1_Waste_Management_Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">our factsheet</a> on our plastic use.\r\n\r\nOur strategy to resource use and waste management is through this process:\r\n\r\n<img class="img-responsive hidden-cx visible-sm visible-md visible-lg" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/waste_management_strategy.gif" alt="" /> <img class="img-responsive visible-cx hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/waste_management_strategy_mobile.gif" alt="" />', 'Waste Management Matters', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '179-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-21 02:16:57', '2014-07-21 02:16:57', '', 179, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/179-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We recognise the impacts of using and disposing of these materials, such as the shortage of landfill space in Hong Kong. Therefore we have medium to long-term programmes in place to minimise these impacts. While we were seen by our stakeholders as having improved in this area, they expect to see continued action on this urgent issue.</p>\r\nIn particular, our staff are concerned about what they can do in the working environment, for example flight and cabin crew wanted to see more being done on inflight waste, while our ground staff wanted to see more done in the offices and airports. This is a positive sign, as we are seeing our staff more willing to be involved in reducing our use of resources and increasing recycling and re-using where we can. This is encouraging as a lot of our resource and waste management initiatives can only be achieved with the support of our staff both inflight and on the ground.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, we have received considerable attention on our use of plastics inflight – this was consistent amongst our different stakeholders – from passengers, staff and environmental organisations. We have provided a detailed section in <a class="factsheet-link" href="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/pdf/factsheet/CX_SDR2013_E1_Waste_Management_Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">our factsheet</a> on our plastic use.\r\n\r\nOur strategy to resource use and waste management is through this process:\r\n\r\n<img class="img-responsive hidden-cx visible-sm visible-md visible-lg" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/waste_management_strategy.gif" alt="" /> <img class="img-responsive visible-cx hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg" src="http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/wp-content/themes/cathay/assets/img/waste_management_strategy_mobile.gif" alt="" />', 'Waste Management Matters', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '179-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-21 09:36:00', '2014-07-21 09:36:00', '', 179, 'http://cx-sr2013.sedgwick-richardson.hk/179-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
